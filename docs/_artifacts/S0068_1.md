RECEIVED
APR 9 1930

February 11th, 1930
To the Board of Trustees, Common School District No. 5, Town of Colonie, County of Albany, Present:-

Under provisions of section 141 of the State Education Law as amended to July 1st, 1929, we, the under-signed inhabitants and legal voters of Common School District No. 5, Town of Colonie, County of Albany, do hereby call upon your honorable body to give public notice, within the next ten days, of a special public meeting to be held to be held at a time not less than twenty days nor more than thirty days after the posting of such notice, which posting shall be taken on this resolution which we now propose.

Whereas, in order to establish a high school in the Second Union Free School District of the town of Colonie, it becomes necessary to change our name from that of Common School District to Union Free School District and whereas such a move will not entail any further financial obligations upon this district which will not be ameliorated by autional state funds derived from the maintenance of such a high school, it is therefore resolved that this district be duly designated as a Union Free School District and as such be qualified to enjoy the privileges of the University of the State of New York and its board of Regents.

Whereas our children will be unable to receive that higher education required by law unless such a district is formed, be it therefore resolved by law that this district is formed.
