Notes:
- The handwritten text at the top appears to be a list of names or terms, possibly related to school officials or contributors, but is too unclear to transcribe accurately.
- The numbers below seem to represent financial figures or records, likely related to school district finances or tax records.
- The years at the bottom likely represent a timeline of school district records or significant events.
- The [stamp: ...] notation indicates an official seal or mark from the New York State Common School System, though the specific details of the stamp are not legible.
