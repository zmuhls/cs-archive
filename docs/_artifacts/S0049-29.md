STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION. 79

[illegible]

CONCLUSION.

I must conclude upon the instant. Even the hasty and superficial examination of the rise and development of our State common school system, which we have been able to make in a single evening, will be fruitful of suggestions which your interest in the subject will easily enable you to discern. The one which comes to me with more force than any other is that history clearly and unmistakably reveals the fact that free schools have invariably and inevitably been the accompaniment and the support of civil liberty and the government by the people. Wherever there has been common schools mental strength and manly independence have developed, and the government has been a democracy, and the government has only been a name. We can not doubt the stability and the permanence of our social fabric. It is the warp and woof of our governmental temple. The most deserving and the most perfect its machinery, to make its work ennobling and its life pure. The most deserving and the most perfect its machinery, to make its work ennobling and its life pure.
