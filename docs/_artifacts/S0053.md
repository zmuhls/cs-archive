The image provided is a blank sheet of paper with no visible text or content to transcribe. The only discernible feature is a handwritten name in the top right corner, which appears to be "Lida S. Penfield." Since there is no additional text or content on the document, the transcription would simply include this name.

Transcription:
Lida S. Penfield
