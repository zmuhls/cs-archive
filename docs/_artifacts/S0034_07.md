The New York State Teachers' Association

separated. It pays to rub elbows with our fellow workers. Many of our best teachers holding the highest positions at- tribute their rise in the profession to their wide acquaintance with teachers in general and their close acquaintance with edu- cational leaders.

Membership in a strong, active, efficient organization of the workers in our branch of professional service is a source of inspiration and of a feeling of independence.

Every teacher worthy of the name wants to do her everyday classroom work just as well as it can be done, and be done, and attendance at Association meetings will help her to do it.

The teacher also desires to participate in more general com- munity and civic activities. The Association affords a medium through which she may assert her rights, exercise her citizenship, and perform some important duties as a citizen.

It should be remembered also, that many bills considered detrimental to the welfare of teachers or harmful to the schools were defeated largely through the watchfulness and initiative of our Association.

All these reasons for joining and supporting the Association should be made known to all teachers—not only to induce them to become members, but to imbue them with the spirit of the organization. The State Teachers' Association is a big, going concern; it is recognized as a leading factor in the educational progress; it has become a necessary part of our educational system. Therefore, it deserves the hearty co-operation and loyal support of every teacher in the Empire State.

Let us have a 100% enrollment of teachers in every super- visory district of the State for the year 1926-27.

Cordially yours,

RICHARD A. SEARING,  
Secretary
