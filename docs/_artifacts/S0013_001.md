appropriate, therefore, that it should review the record of its aims
and its achievements and note the work yet to be done. All the objectives of the New York State Teachers Association
are too numerous to list here. Some of the major ones have been these:

FREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. First, free elementary schools; then, free
high schools; and later, free higher education.

EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. For females; for negroes; for rural
children; through compulsory education; and the prohibiting of child
labor.

PROFESSIONALIZATION OF TEACHING. Separate education department;
supervision by teachers only; national
bureau of education; teachers' magazine written by teachers; national
teachers' association; pensions; higher prerequisites to teaching; tenure
for competent teachers; minimum salaries; professional training required of all teachers; welfare fund; and academic freedom.

ADQUATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. Larger tax districts; state taxation
for schools; increased state aid; equitable distribution of state aid;
broader tax base; and federal aid for public education.

PROTECTION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION FROM DIVISION OF SCHOOL FUNDS;
from attacks of private school interest; from legislative controls; from
attacks of selfish tax-
payers; from political controls; from legislative interference with the
curriculum; from repeal of protractive legislation for teachers; from
reduction of state aid; from constitutional tax limitation.

IMPROVING PUBLIC EDUCATION THROUGH HUNDREDS OF SPECIFIC REFORMS
advocated since the association since the association was organized in 1845.
