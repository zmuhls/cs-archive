This collection presents statistical data, registries, and reference materials for quantitative and geographic research on New York State school district evolution. Unlike the narrative governance records, these materials serve as data sources for spatial analysis, consolidation pattern research, and administrative history.

## Overview

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Total Pages** | 179 |
| **Series** | B0594, B0494 |
| **Theme** | Statistics, registries, reference data |
| **Coverage** | Statewide (29+ counties) |

**Research Questions Enabled:**

- Which counties consolidated most aggressively?
- What was the timeline of district mergers across NYS?
- How did consolidation types differ (Central Rural vs. Union Free vs. Town Units)?
- What patterns emerge in district name changes and registrations?
- Can we map the geographic spread of education reform?

## County Consolidation Tables

**116 pages | Series B0494 | 29 Counties**

Statistical tables documenting school district consolidations across New York State, organized by county. Each table type tracks different consolidation structures:

- **Union Free Schools**: Voter-created districts crossing town lines
- **Town School Units**: Township-based consolidated districts
- **Consolidated Districts**: Merged common school districts
- **Central Rural Schools**: Centralized rural district systems

### Sample Table (Cattaraugus County, Page 10)

| District | Town | Date Org | Date Appr | Remarks |

| CRS 1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 | New Albion, Mumford, Otts, Dayton, Austin, Leon, East Otts | Laid out June 6, 1946 | June 25, 1946 | CRS 1 New Albion |
| CRS 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 | Allegany, Carrollton, Humphrey | Laid out June 9, 1947 | June 30, 1947 | CRS 1 Allegany |

- Peak years for district mergers
- Seasonal patterns (school year timing)

### Quantitative Research

- Districts per county before/after consolidation
- Consolidation type distribution by region
- Cross-reference with governance decisions (Collection 2)
