## Comparative Analysis

### Governance Evolution (1815 → 1930s)

| Aspect | South-Kortright (1810s) | Amityville (1930s) |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Voting** | Direct votes by inhabitants | Formal motions, seconds, votes by board |
| **Participants** | Freeholders and inhabitants | Elected board members, committees |
| **Records** | Handwritten, informal | Typed, formal minutes |
| **Finances** | Wood delivery, teacher wages | Detailed purchase orders, budgets |
| **Teachers** | Hired for 6 months, inspected | Standing Teachers Committee |
| **Facilities** | One-room schoolhouse | Multiple buildings, maintenance contracts |

### Research Themes

1. **Bureaucratic Formalization**: Track the shift from informal votes to parliamentary procedure
2. **Women in Governance**: Mrs. Hartman and Grace Burns appear in Amityville minutes
3. **Economic Context**: Depression-era salary negotiations vs. early 19th century subsistence
4. **Curriculum Evolution**: Basic literacy (1810s) to electricity classes and dancing (1930s)
