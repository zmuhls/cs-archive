## Why This Organization?

### Governance vs. Administration Split

**Governance Records** (Collection 2) show decision-making processes: meeting minutes, debates, votes, committee reports, and temporal narratives of school board actions.

**Administrative Data** (Collection 3) show outcomes and statistics: reference materials, lookup tables, registries, and data sources for quantitative research.

This distinction mirrors archival practice (correspondence vs. registers), enables different research methods (qualitative vs. quantitative), and separates process from product.
