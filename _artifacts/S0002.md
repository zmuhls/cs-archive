The image provided is a modern academic bibliography page and does not contain a historical document from the New York State Common School system (1800s-1900s). Therefore, it cannot be transcribed according to the rules specified for historical documents from that era.

If you have a specific historical document from the New York State Common School system that you would like transcribed, please provide it, and I would be happy to assist you in transcribing it according to the rules you've outlined.
