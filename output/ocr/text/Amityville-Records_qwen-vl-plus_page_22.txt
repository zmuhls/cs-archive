Mr. Lewis Inglis ---- 2

commendable characteristics of requiring that the district build at this time a building of minimum size to provide sufficient pupil stations to meet the immediate needs of the district by leaving to the future the opportunity to make further extensions as needed. While I should very much have preferred that the district plan to build in connection with the proposed unit an auditorium of such size as to meet both the present and future auditorium needs of the district I shall be pleased to recommend that the grade unit be approved without requiring that such auditorium needs be made in the present unit of construction if this is the wish of the Board of Education and the electors in this district. It seems fair that this be done since the rate of growth in your district is such that within a comparatively short time it will be necessary to further extend the school plant and at that time the auditorium needs of the district can be taken care of.

There is one further suggestion that I believe is worthy of the very serious consideration of the Amityville Board of Education and the electors in this District. The present time the old grade building is provided with extremely poor heating and ventilating systems. The high school is taken care of by a separate heating system. When this new grade unit is built it will be necessary to take care of it with still another separate heating system. We would recommend that you plan and include in the proposed grade building accommodations for a central heating plant that can readily be extended later on to serve the needs of all of the buildings constructed on the present site and further that the hostess plant that is now proposed be made to serve immediately the old grade building that is now in use and the grade building which is now proposed. I am pleased to advise on this point however that if the Board of Education believes that it is best to continue for the time being the unsatisfactory system in use in the old building and to provide in the new grade building only for the needs of the new unit at this time we shall be pleased to approve this particular plan upon the request of the Board of Education.
