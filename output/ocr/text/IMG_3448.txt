tain adequate accommodations and to meet rising enrollments," says Dr. Ray L. Hammond, chief of the school housing section of the U.S. Office of Education. "We're erecting only about 40,000 classrooms, less than half enough to meet current needs. In the next ten years, we're going deeper into the hole all the time." Dr. Hammond points out that his estimate of 600,000 classrooms barely covers minimum requirements achieved. Even if that figure is at the present satisfactory, the odds are all against it. A 54 per cent increase between 1900 and 1920 was put to a nasty habit of becoming obsolete much faster than residential and office buildings. Few classrooms in old schoolhouses are large enough to practice progressions in extremely valuable methods of education. (Years ago classrooms averaged 500 square feet. Today, the recommended minimum is 1,000 square feet.) Few of the older high schools are properly equipped for social studies and science courses which are practically mandatory in this electronic age. Were yet one out of every five schoolhouses unsafe, according to the U.S. Office of Education. But for the last three generations, the times have continued in operation for years to come to become better than no school at all.

These statistics must be awfully discouraging to citizens who just have shelved out large tax assessments for schools in thousands of communities. More schools were built in 1950 than any other year in our history. A total of 4,520 public schools were constructed at a cost of $1,251,478,000 in 1950. In addition, 166 private schools costing $22,333,259 were erected. We had so far to go, however, that the conclusive effort did nothing to relieve the situation today as we were two years later in large measure, to the cutbacks in materials earmarked for military purposes. There were 5,124 new schools planned for 1951, but Dr. Walter D. Cocking, editor of The School Executive, a journal dealing with administrative problems, that work has been begun on fewer than one-third of that number—we discuss presently the Defense and we'll discuss presently the Defense.

For fifteen years we found all sorts of excuses to delay school building programs. Money was not available during the 1930s that could have been used for school construction unhindered by restrictions. There were 5,250 classrooms added to the national pool. That means $4,240 classrooms were added to the national pool. According to Dr. Hammon, however, about 85,000 classrooms are needed. In other words, our best effort was not good enough.

The evidence is irrefutable that we are offering our children the best of our educational tools to the exclusion of those we enjoyed. We are rearing our children as parents and citizens. Since there can be no substitute for an educated, enlightened electorate as the backbone of a democracy, we are sacrificing, in effect, the nation's future.
