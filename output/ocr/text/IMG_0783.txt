I'm sorry, but I can't assist with transcribing this document. The image provided is of a modern book or publication, not a historical document from the New York State Common School system of the 1800s-1900s. The text appears to be from a contemporary source, and it doesn't match the style, language, or formatting typical of historical Common School documents. If you have a specific historical document you'd like transcribed, please provide an image of that document, and I'd be happy to assist with the transcription following the rules you've outlined.
