small politicians on the other. They opened the way for the early
understanding of the difficult problem involved, and the general
acceptance of the proposition that teachers in the schools must
not only be liberally educated, but specially and technically
trained, or come short of the requirements of the service. All
honor to the statesmanship which inaugurated, as well as to that
which has since sustained and prosecuted this work so intelligently
and generously. It has contributed more than it knew to the
intellectual and moral health of the commonwealth.

VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS.

The remaining great influence which has promoted the healthful
development of our public school system, and which I shall feel
justified in taking time to consider, is that of voluntary
associations of the friends of education, and particularly of
teachers. This influence has been a most consequential one. The
order in which I mention it must not be accepted as an indication
of its importance. I think you will find the subject interesting.
I know you would if there was time to thoroughly investigate it.

"SOCIETY OF ASSOCIATED TEACHERS," NEW YORK CITY, 1794.

In the custody of the State library at Albany, in company with
the original André papers, the original copy of President Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation, the original of Washington's Farewell
Address, there is a manuscript volume of more interest to us than
any of them. It is the original minutes of the first permanent or
continuing teachers' association in America. It was an association
of schoolmasters, organized in New York city in May, 1794. The
minutes are neatly and correctly kept, and indicate that any one
of the secretaries would have been able to pass the State
examinations for testing the qualifications of teachers in those
days. The journal shows that meetings were held with much regularity
at least till 1807. The first meeting was held May 15, 1794, at the
schoolroom of "Citizen, Gad Ely." The first resolution adopted after
the meeting was one "that the person filling the chair for the time
being, be authorized to call to order any member when necessary."
The fact that this precaution was deemed necessary will at once put
us on terms of easy fellowship with these early teachers. John
Wood was chosen chairman, and John Winchell secretary. Fifteen
persons were present at the first meeting. Opposite nearly every
name in the list, some person has written the words "since dead."
It was essentially a hand-to-hand society, opposite nearly every
name in the list, some person has written the words "since dead."
It was essentially a hand-to-hand society. It may seem superfluous,
therefore, to state the secret society. It may seem superfluous,
therefore, to state the fact that no ladies were admitted. Members
were received by ballot, requiring a three-fourth vote to elect.
The admission fee or at one dollar. Meetings were held in the
school-rooms or at the residences of the members, and ordinarily
about every week.
