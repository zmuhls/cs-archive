are deficient in one or more respects if a site conforming to all standards is not available.

Other changes which the Commission proposes are these:

A. Amend Section 409 of the Education Law to make clear that the Education Commissioner's regulations under this section do not apply to city school districts in cities having 70,000 or more population.

B. Delete the last sentence in Section 1806, subdivision 1-e of the Education Law to eliminate difficulties experienced in interpretation. At the time of voting on a bond issue it is impossible to get more than an estimate of cost, so that the voters cannot be advised of any excess of actual cost over computed building cost.

C. Increase from $50 to $100 the amount which the trustees of common school districts may spend for repairs, furniture and equipment without a vote of the district under subdivision 14 of Section 1604 of the Education Law; and from $150 to $300 the amount which a trustee of such district may expend for repairs without a vote of the people when ordered by the district superintendent to do so under subdivision 4 of Section 2215 of the Education Law.

6. Continue the Commission

In his 1952 message to the Legislature, Governor Dewey commended the Commission for its work and recommended its continuance for another year. Legislation to continue the Commission already has been approved. A bill appropriating $100,000 for its work in the 1952-53 State fiscal year will be introduced.

A large volume of important work remains to be done. For instance:

A. It is anticipated a shortage of materials will continue to be a major problem in school construction during the year. The Commission will continue its efforts to find methods of conserving materials needed in the nation's defense effort and will assist small districts to obtain Federal approval of essential school construction and Federal allocation of critical materials. Small districts frequently are at a disadvantage in obtaining construction priorities because they lack the direct contact with Federal officials that is possessed by many cities.

B. In the fall of 1952, many more school districts will begin to feel the effects of increased enrollments in the elementary schools. It is expected there will be increases in the number of districts seeking advances of State money for emergency school building construction. The Commission will endeavor to simplify and improve the administration of the emergency advance statute. In considering future applications for advances, particular attention should be given to determining accuracy of enrollment estimates, the need for enlarging school districts, capacity and utilization of available schools in the area and possible adjustments in the formula used to compute the emergency advance.

C. It is expected that the review and revision of State equalization rates will be completed within the year. Establishment of new rates will require a review of local financial resources, reconsideration of the formula used in making advances of money for local debt service on emergency school construction and an examination of the effect changes in the State education aid formula will have upon the ability of localities to finance their own school building requirements.

D. In view of the shortage of materials, high construction costs, expanding need for elementary schools and the increased need for high schools that can be expected within a six year period, it is imperative the Commission complete its development of the best method of modernizing existing schools and increasing their capacity and utilization, particularly during periods of peak enrollment.

It also is important that the Commission continue its search for economies in planning and construction of schools and continue to give the localities guidance in meeting temporary overcrowding.

B. The Commission should continue its work on school district reorganization so that completion of this program will be possible before 1960 when many more high schools will be needed. Unless elementary school construction is planned economically and financed soundly, the school districts will face their greatest difficulties when high school enrollments start growing. Before a district considers expanding high school facilities it is important that it study the possibility of enlarging the district to include all the territory which it should serve.

LOCAL ACTION

The Commission urges that in the year immediately ahead and during the next five or six years of rapidly rising school enrollments all of the school districts in the State adhere to these recommendations:

1. Follow the procedures for determining need, as outlined by this Commission, before undertaking school construction.
