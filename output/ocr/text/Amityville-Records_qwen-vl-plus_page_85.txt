Ayes: Six
Nees: none
Absent: One

The President thereupon declared the resolution duly adopted.

The President announced that the Police Department did not have sufficient officers to properly police the intersection of Ireland Place and Park Avenue during school hours and that due to a shortage of funds the Village Board was not in a position to engage the services of another officer for this duty. The President further stated that it had been suggested that the Board pay the Village of Amityville $20. per week for the employment of an additional officer for this work until the next village budget could be made up. After a discussion of the proposition it was moved duly seconded and carried, that the sum of $20. be paid the Village of Amityville until March 1, 1931, for police service during school hours.
