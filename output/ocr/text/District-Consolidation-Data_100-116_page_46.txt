**Notes:**
- The handwritten notes on the left margin ("WDS #2" and "104271") are not included in the table as they are not part of the structured data.
- The "REMARKS" column is left blank for all entries as no specific remarks are provided in the document.
- The table preserves the original structure with clear column headers and aligned data.
