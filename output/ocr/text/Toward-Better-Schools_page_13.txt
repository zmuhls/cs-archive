**Problems Created by the National Emergency**

The rapidly expanding defense effort of the United States has made it increasingly difficult to obtain critical materials for construction of urgently needed school buildings.

Recognizing the tremendous problem that this posed for the school districts individually, the Commission directed its staff to exert every effort to assist in overcoming this major obstacle.

The United States Office of Education required school districts to apply directly for allocation of critical materials and did not assign priorities on a state wide basis. Therefore, the Commission did not use standby legislation under which the State Defense Council could assign priorities to school buildings and channel applications for Federal allocations of material.

Early in the year, the Commission asked its staff to begin studies of the possibility of reducing the use of steel, copper and aluminum in school construction. Beginning in September, 1951, the Commission issued a series of Information Bulletins showing how these scarce materials could be conserved. The bulletins were distributed to architects and school authorities throughout the State.

This pioneer effort to conserve critical materials drew commendation at a Congressional hearing in Washington and elsewhere in the Nation. Subsequently, the Commission sent bulletins upon request to many architects, educators and construction men in other states.

Last April, with the cooperation of the State Education Department, the Commission made a survey to determine to what extent school construction was being delayed by material shortages. It found that about 20 per cent of the buildings under construction were encountering shortages which could delay occupancy of the buildings. Most of the delays were caused by lack of structural steel.
