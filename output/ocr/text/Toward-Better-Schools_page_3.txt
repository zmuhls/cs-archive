LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

To the Governor and the Legislature of the State of New York:

The Commission on School Buildings, created by Chapter 612 of the Laws of 1950, presents herewith its third report concerning school building problems in New York State.

This report demonstrates that with few exceptions the localities in the State which have had serious school building problems have made significant progress in solving them.

Many communities will be confronted with similar problems for a decade at least, but measures already adopted by the Legislature or being recommended by the Commission, will enable school districts to continue to make outstanding progress in the future, subject, of course, to any restrictions caused by our country's defense needs.

Respectfully submitted,

Frank C. Moore
Chairman

February 15, 1952
