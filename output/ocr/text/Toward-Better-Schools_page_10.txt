Forecast of Needs

The Commission made a major effort during the past two years to find methods, procedures and standards which can and should be used locally to make more accurate estimates of the need for new school buildings. The determination of future need for school facilities in individual school districts or segments of school districts presents difficult questions, most of which can best be answered at the local level once the facts are known. As pointed out previously by the Commission, future need is affected by a great many factors, such as: Changes in district boundaries; capacity, utilization and condition of existing buildings; space standards; relative advantages and costs of rehabilitating, modernizing or replacing existing buildings; policy and standards on design and construction of new buildings; estimates of future enrollments, and policy on accommodations for temporary enrollment increases.

The Commission has completed its studies of enrollment forecasting and these are summarized in its first manual which now is being printed for the guidance of local officials. The fact that the number of births in 1953 almost reached the 1947 peak means that enrollment increases will create school building problems for another fifteen or sixteen years. However, the Commission has found no reason for altering its conclusion that the present high level of births is not likely to continue very long.

In a second manual being prepared the Commission will detail its findings to date on standards, costs and economies in the design and construction of school buildings. Still in the experimental stage are standards and procedures for determining the capacity, utilization, condition and relative advantages and costs of rehabilitating, modernizing, or replacing existing substandard buildings.

The Commission is still working to solve remaining difficulties hampering reliable forecasts of school building requirements. (See Third Section).

Lighting Study

In considering the development of designs for better schools at lower cost, the Commission gave special attention to the effect of classroom lighting standards. Research has indicated that by effective use of modern artificial lighting techniques, window space may be reduced and more functional classrooms designed at lower construction cost.

The question unanswered, however, was: Would the reduction in window areas and the greater use of artificial lighting harm the physical and mental health of children?

A committee of physicians, lighting engineers, architects, educators and parents was asked by the Commission to answer this question and to make recommendations for the guidance of the Commission.

After reviewing evidence presented by various specialists, the Committee unanimously agreed greater use could be made of adequate and proper artificial light in a suitable classroom environment (i.e.: clear windows and pleasant color schemes) without harm to the children.

This Committee's recommendations for revision of the State Education Department's present lighting regulations can pave the way for construction of more functional and economical school buildings. Some of the details of this study are covered in Section III of this report.
