Mr. Richard Theekray, Jr., appeared before the Board and stated that last fall he had asked for a share of the school insurance but had heard nothing on the matter to date. Mr. Theekray again petitioned the Board for a proportionate share of any insurance and explained the plan used by the Village in which each qualified agent receives an equal share of the commission on all insurance written. The President stated that the Board was not prepared to act on the question at this time but that the matter would be looked into.

The Teachers Committee reported no unexcusable absences for the month of February but stated that the following had served as substitute teachers:

Mrs. Emma Dayton, taught 5 days,
Mrs. Angeline Kinne,     3½ days,
Mrs. Alice Morris,        9 days,
Mrs. Teresa Bunce,        1 day,
Mrs. Catherine Powell,    9 days,
Miss Gates,               2 days.

Mrs. Hartman moved and Mr. Case seconded the motion that the report be received, approved and made a matter of record and that the substitute teachers be paid accordingly. This motion unanimously carried.
