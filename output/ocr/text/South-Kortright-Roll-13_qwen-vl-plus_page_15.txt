**Notes:**

- The word "[illegible]" appears where the text is too faded or unclear to decipher accurately.
- There is a correction noted where "Grae" appears to be a contraction or abbreviation for a longer name, possibly "George."
- The phrase "accepting Daniel Foot" suggests a conditional acceptance or agreement involving Daniel Foot.
- The text "the by-laws providing they have heretofore been except that Teacher shall examine the quality of the wood and report accordingly" seems to be a correction or clarification, possibly indicating an exception to a previous by-law regarding the teacher's responsibilities.
- The document appears to be written by a single hand, with no clear indication of multiple writers present.

This transcription aims to capture the exact wording and structure of the original document, preserving its historical and linguistic characteristics.
