5. **Corrections and Insertions:** A correction is noted for the uncertain word in the sentence about the debt to John Griffin.
6. **Different Hands:** The signatures at the bottom appear to be from two different hands, as indicated by the distinct styles of the names "James [illegible]" and "Amos Griffin."
