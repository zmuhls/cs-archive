The Clerk read letter from Leonard J. Smith, District Superintendent dated August 8, 1929, as follows:

"It has come to my attention that certain members of boards of education or trustees have questioned the church affiliations of candidates for the position of teacher in the public schools in this Supervisory District. This is entirely wrong and contrary to the spirit and letter of the Education Law. Where this has been done in the past, I hope and trust that it will be discontinued entirely in the future. Please notify me of any violations of the law in this respect."

The Clerk was instructed to acknowledge the communication.

Motion made, duly seconded and carried, that the Purchasing Committee advertise, receive bids and place contract for the coal requirements for the ensuing year.

Motion made, duly seconded and carried, that the Transportation Committee advertise, receive bids and place contract for transportation of pupils for the ensuing school year.
