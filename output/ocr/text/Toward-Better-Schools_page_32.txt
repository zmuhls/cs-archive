ity to Finance Schools

Approximately $40 million of this annual total would provide 15 to 20 new schools each year to relieve overcrowding or to replace buildings that are not worth modernizing. With the balance of about $10 million, the City could modernize 15 to 25 additional schools each year.

To accomplish successfully a program of this scope, the City Board of Education, in the opinion of the Commission, must improve its organization and procedures as suggested in the recommendations for local action summarized in Section V of this report.

Other School Districts

During 1950 and 1951, the State provided for advances of money to financially hard pressed school districts to help them with debt service on emergency school construction. Under certain conditions prescribed by Section 3603-e of the Education Law, a school district is eligible for this type of assistance when its local tax rate for approved debt service goes above $7 on $1,000 full valuation of local real property.

Continuation of the State's emergency advance program for another year will enable all of the non-city school districts to finance school construction which will be necessary in that period without an excessive local tax burden.
