Mr. C. R. Warren, Clerk.

The minutes of the previous regular meeting were read and approved.

The President announced that the regular order of business would be dispensed with in order that the Board could receive Mr. Jacobson of Jacob & Smith, who appeared before the Board requesting information as to why final payment had been withheld on contract for renovating the heating system of the Grammar School. Mr. Cornwell reported that the heating system was not operating properly and with that in mind the Building Committee could not recommend payment of the bill; at least not until Mr. Foose, Engineer, could be brought before the Board and it be determined who was at fault. Mr. Jacobson outlined to the Board what would be necessary to place the system in proper working order and the President instructed him to prepare and submit to the Board an estimate of the cost of such work.

The Clerk read letter of Thomas J. Cuff, Attorney at Law, Hempstead, New York, written on behalf of the V. P. Moore Engineering Company, Inc.; threatening to commence action to collect an outstanding balance alleged to be due them of $200.00. On motion made, duly seconded and carried, the Clerk was instructed to answer the letter.

The Clerk read letter of Mr. E. T. Bregaw to Mr. Clinton Ingles, informing the Board of his intention to leave the teaching profession at the end of the current school year in order to enter upon a business career. The Clerk read Mr. Ingles's letter in answer, expressing the regret of the Board and the people of the Village in the loss of his future services. Motion made, duly seconded and carried, that the Clerk thank Mr. Bregaw for his timely notice of his intention to leave the faculty and that the Board express through its Secretary its regrets.
