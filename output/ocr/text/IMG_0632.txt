The New York State Teachers' Association

WHY EVERY TEACHER SHOULD JOIN THE STATE ASSOCIATION

Since there are several thousand teachers who have not yet joined our Association, we feel that they should carefully consider the reasons why it is their duty to join our organization.

1. Because group and class organization is now considered absolutely necessary and the New York State Teachers' Association is the only big all inclusive teacher organization of the State. This is an age of organization and organized effort. The successful carrying out of our program is possible only by the co-operation of all the teachers of the State. Nothing big or important can be accomplished in these days except through organization and co-operation. If the teachers of the State are to perform all their duties and functions as teachers, and command the respect of other professions and other organized classes, they must have a strong and active organization functioning as a State unit.

2. Because it helps in a professional way. The zone or district meetings will furnish excellent programs on professional topics. Educational addresses will be delivered by great leaders. In-spiring addresses will be discussed by experts. Our Journal goes to all members ten times a year to keep them informed concerning the problems, program and activities of the Association. The esprit de corps thus developed in the teachers enables them to work more happily and efficiently. When we have 100% attendance at the meetings, we shall be able to stay outside. No teacher can afford to stay outside. When we have 100% in our membership, we shall be able to secure any and all reasons able consideration for the teachers' welfare.

New York State as a whole is certainly responding nobly to the demand for more money for teaching. But we must be ready with the reaction now setting in and we must be with strong organization to meet it. Attendance at the meetings promotes closer acquaintance and good fellowship among teachers who are otherwise widely separated. [stamp: New York State Teachers' Association]
