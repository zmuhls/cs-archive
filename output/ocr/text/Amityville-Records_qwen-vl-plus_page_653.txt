"Item of Capital Outlay to be increased to $17,600.00
Total budget to be increased to $169,625.00.
That from said total budget of $169,625.00 and in addition to the item of $37,500.00 to be deducted covering public money that the sum of $15,000. be also deducted covering the estimated surplus on hand the close of the fiscal year 1929-30"

Mr. Vogel recommended that if a "Clerk of the Job" be to be erected that the Architect be engaged by the Board to protect the Board's interest. Architect Ingles agreed to this proposition.
