JOHN T. NICHOLSON, Esquire

DEAR SIR:

Your favor of the 20th of March has only just reached me. I think every American who has any love for his country must see that our homes for a fair day's work as well as our schools for the best in the full as well as the best in the republic; and next to their parents, the children's teachers will have the most to do with making good citizens of the children. I have been glad to observe, in late years, how much the New York State and city schools are doing to teach the children the good lessons of any patriotism. They learn to be the good citizens of any country. They learn to love their country just as much as their local baseball club; and the former affection is lasting. It is one of the cheering things on the part of our teachers that they are quick to catch the infection of any enthusiasm. Children are quick to catch the infection of any enthusiasm. They learn to be the good citizens of any country. They learn to love their country just as much as their local baseball club; and the former affection is lasting.
