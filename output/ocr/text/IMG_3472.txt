**SCHOOLS ARE BIG BUSINESS**

For example, the school district of one typical Midwestern city of 100,000 population has a capital investment in its school plant of $9,315,924, employs a total personnel of 663, and spends each year approximately $3,410,177 for current operation. No single business firm in this city can match these figures. The same thing will hold true, with few exceptions, in communities of every size throughout our land.

It should follow, then, that merely from a business standpoint, the job of superintendent of schools is one of the biggest administrative jobs in the community. In some areas, the superintendent of schools is responsible for transporting more individuals each day than all public transportation services combined. He is often responsible for school lunchrooms serving more people than all the hotels and restaurants combined. He is always responsible for safeguarding the health and well-being of a larger segment of the population than ever falls at one time under the care of all the area's social agencies combined. When we add to such physical and material aspects a consideration of the enduring human values which we expect to evolve from the educational process, the importance of the responsibility resting upon the superintendent becomes even more apparent.
