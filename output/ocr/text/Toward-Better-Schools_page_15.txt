In accepting the Commission's recommendations, the U.S. Commissioner of Education said:
"The applications from New York reflect the work your Commission has done in the conservation of critical materials and your cooperation in this regard is much appreciated."

New York City

A year ago, the Commission pointed out that it was not a lack of money that had retarded school construction in New York City. Disunity and mismanagement had placed a practical limit on the number of schools which could be built in a year, regardless of the need.

After detailed study of the school construction bottlenecks in the City, the Commission reported five major sources of delay:
Lack of co-ordination among the numerous agencies involved;
failure to disburse funds and priorities;
ineffective practices in planning the building program;
time-consuming procedures in selecting, acquiring and clearing sites, and
failure to have plans and specifications ready when needed.

The Commission recommended appointment of a temporary school construction co-ordinator and suggested for reaching changes in responsibilities, procedures and practices for the Board of Education and its staff as a means of removing the obstacles which thwarted the City's efforts to build schools its children needed.

It is gratifying to observe how quickly adoption of several of the Commission's recommendations was translated into substantial progress in the construction of schools.

The 1951 Program

With a school construction co-ordinator functioning, bids for construction of the 31 schools included in the

14

City's 1951 capital program were received within that year. All except one of the schools were authorized for construction by the Board of Estimate and contracts were awarded. The one exception was a school which, after receipt of bids, was deferred to 1962 for redesign to effect economies.

The 1951 capital program cost almost $67 million of which $19 million was for eight projects carried over from the previous year.

Successful initiation of this large program is evidence of increased co-operation among the City agencies concerned with the construction of schools. As an example of this new co-operation, it can be noted that advance agreement among City agencies enabled the Board of Education's Bureau of Design to start preparation of plans for eight of the schools in the 1952 program two months before the beginning of the year.

The 1951 program, however, was criticized in the interim report of the Education Management Survey, a subcommittee of the New York City Mayor's Committee on Management Survey.

The Survey recommended elimination of six of the projects included in the Board of Education's 1951 program and transfer of money to other projects for which greater need could be established. The Survey declared the six schools unnecessary, if existing schools in their areas were better utilized.

Commenting on the Survey's recommendation, without passing upon the substantiation of need for any school, the Mayor's Committee said that "Adequate organization and procedures do not now exist to assure that sound decisions of this sort will be arrived at."

The Committee strongly recommended that "decisions as to new construction be deferred wherever possible, pending development of a greatly strengthened planning organization."

The Board of Education, however, made no changes in its 1951 program.

The Commission endorses this recommendation of the Mayor's Committee with respect to new construction.
Although a start has been made by the Board of Education toward accomplishing the recommended changes in organization and procedures, they need to be carried through promptly, if sound decisions are to be made and the school building problem met.
