have been housed and high school enrollments begin to rise again.

5. Exercise the utmost economy in school construction, consistent with education values and maintenance costs.

6. Make maximum use of borrowing power through short maturities and special efforts to obtain favorable interest rates, and use reserve funds and current revenues to reduce the amount of borrowing.

New York City

The Commission recommends that New York City appropriate approximately $50 million a year during the next four years for construction of new schools and modernization of old ones. About $40 million should be spent each year for 15 to 20 new schools to relieve overcrowding and $10 million each year for 15 to 25 modernization projects. However, this program substantially eliminates the backlog of school construction and modernization needs in the City cannot be accomplished unless the following steps are taken:

1. The City must appropriate sufficient funds annually to keep its school buildings in repair and the Board of Education must streamline its organization for handling repair work.

2. The Board of Education must put into effect without further delay the recommendations of this Commission, the Management Survey and its own construction coordinator for properly dividing responsibility between the Board and its staff and achieving an effective and efficient staff organization to plan and supervise construction of schools.

3. In cooperation with the City Planning Commission and the Office of the Budget Director, the Board of Education must immediately appraise the condition, capacity and utilization of all schools in the City and determine their place in the overall construction program. Without this information, it is impossible for the Board to establish whether buildings should be replaced or modernized and in what order construction of new buildings or modernization of old should take place.

On the basis of experience gained in its State-wide studies, the Commission believes this physical inventory

of existing schools could be completed in six months with a staff of 12 persons. It would be to the Board of Education's advantage to release 12 competent engineers, architects and other persons familiar with schools and their construction to do this work during the next six months, even if one or more school projects had to be given to private architects for planning in the meantime. If the City-wide appraisal began with the oldest buildings and those of wooden construction, the Board soon would have specific information available to modify its 1952 school construction program, if necessary, and to begin planning its 1953 program.

Other Cities

Other cities in the State which have a backlog of school building replacement and modernization projects should undertake a similar appraisal of all their schools in order to plan a well-spaced schedule for meeting their needs. Such a program is much sounder, both from an educational and financial point of view, than one which continually postpones capital projects and places an undue heavy burden upon some future generation of taxpayers.

Other School Districts

School districts outside the cities and some city school districts within the next decade will face a large and expensive program to accommodate increased enrollments of high school pupils. Unless these high schools are supported by all of the territory from which the pupils come, the debt burden for high schools on top of the debt incurred to house increased elementary school enrollments will strain local financial resources.
