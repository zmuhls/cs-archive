sion and Bureau of the Budget and the pilot study was launched in August, 1961, in an area bounded by the Hudson River on the west and Central Park on the east. North and south boundaries fixed tentatively at 116th Street and 59th Street were left to adjustment as the study progressed.

The purpose of this study is to test standards and procedures already developed by the Commission and the New York City agencies and to seek agreement on the data, standards, procedures, organization and staffing required to determine and justify the need for school buildings in a given area—with particular attention to modernization versus replacement.

A second purpose is to discover, if possible, a method of establishing the relative order of construction for all types of needs.

Although the study is being conducted in the City of New York, the information developed from it is expected to be equally valuable in making rehabilitation, modernization or replacement determinations in other cities of the State.

Staff representatives from the Commission and the City agencies have organized committees on capacity and utilization of buildings, inventory and appraisal of buildings and enrollment estimation.

To date these results have been achieved:

1. The Committee on Capacity and Utilization has agreed upon a definition of terms and has determined the standards and methods to be applied in computing capacity.

2. The Committee on Enrollment Estimation has prepared maps showing public and parochial school enrollment and utilization; has tentatively forecast future enrollments and has compiled figures on migration and birth rate.

3. The Committee on Inventory and Appraisal, after studying and testing two methods, has adopted a concise rating form for recording information on a school building.

4. The eleven school buildings in the area have been screened and rated by a team composed of an architect, an educator and a City borough inspector. Floor plan sketches have been completed for all the buildings.

The Commission has continued its studies of possible economies and has summarized its findings to date in an annual now being prepared for distribution. Supplements will be issued as other studies are completed.

The first year's studies were limited to elementary school buildings and were used as a basis for space and cost allowance incorporated into the revision of the law providing emergency advances to financially hard-pressed districts.

This year, the Commission has concentrated on cost and space allowances for secondary school buildings and is offering recommendations based upon these studies. It should be noted the Commission's Information Bulletins on conserving critical materials also suggest means of achieving economy in construction.

Experiments with demonstrable partitions are being continued at Pratt Institute. The work on prefabricated sectional classrooms has gone through the design stage but production studies must be postponed while metals are so scarce.

Economy in Construction

In its second report, the Commission indicated that it found numerous opportunities for economy in school planning and construction.

School Lighting Standards

Present standards for school lighting, which are enforced by the State Education Department in school districts under 70,000 population and generally followed in other places, were found to be outmoded and to result in higher construction costs than might be necessary in view of modern day techniques in lighting and building design.
