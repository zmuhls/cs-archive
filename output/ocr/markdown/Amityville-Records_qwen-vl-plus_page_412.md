JOHNS-MANVILLE
292 MADISON AVENUE AT 41ST STREET
NEW YORK
December 4, 1926.

Mr. L.H. Vogel, Chairman,
Building & Grounds Committee,
Board of Education,
122 Broadway,
Amityville, L.I.

Dear Sir

We understand from our representatives, who met you, together with other members of the board and Mr. L. Ingles, archt. at above school building, Thursday, December 2nd, that we have agreed to make repairs to the main roof. These will not only include the few air blisters in the roofing felt due to excessive distortion of the roof deck over which we have no control.

We beg to submit the following proposition for your consideration, which we understand you requested from our representatives and which is based on our actual costs both for materials and workmanship executed by our own men.

On the main roof only, over all sections which have shown cracks in the putty and which are indicated by repairs that have been made from time to time, we will apply a dry sheet of our Asbestos Roofing Felt, same to act as a lap joint to take care of any expansion and contraction in the future at these points. Over the entire area of this roof deck we will furnish and apply our 15 lb. Roofing Felt in two ply construction, mopped solidly to ema and finished with a hot top mopping of our Standard Roofing Asphalt.

Our cost for doing this work amounts to $707.00, and if favored with your order to proceed we will make an allowance of $51.00, which is our cost for executing repairs as mentioned above or $656.00.
