STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION. 997

continues his work of the two previous years, especially in psychology, pedagogy, logic and philosophy. Theory and practice are made to go hand in hand, and the young graduate is armed with some knowledge of the philosophy of education, as well as knowledge of how to apply it. After graduation the young man is given work in a public school but his training does not yet cease. He must serve two years as a halslehrer, or assistant, after which, if he has given proof of his capability, he is a regularly constituted teacher and is given a permanent place.

Is it to be wondered at, after the course of training above indicated, that Germany has such a magnificent corps of teachers, and consequently such a thorough system of education? There are many things in the German system that cannot be applied to our peculiar conditions. But there is not one incident in their plan of training teachers which is not entirely practicable to America. We have borrowed the idea of Normal schools from Germany, and have adopted much of her plan. Let us go as far as she does, and insist that our Normal schools shall be training schools for teachers only, and not academies for general culture, and that in connection with every one shall be a training school in which the young teachers who are soon to be sent forth, shall be trained in the actual, practical duties of their office. Let us see to it that every young man and woman who goes out from our Normal schools has been taught that there is a science of education, of the fundamental principles of which he is already master.

After the reading of this paper some time was given to questions and discussion.
Professor C. D. Larkins, of New Paltz, opened the discussion upon "Teachers' Institutes." Mr. Larkins represented himself as the faultfinder of the occasion, and proceeded to point out the defects in the present system of conducting institutes:

1. The subjects of instruction lack continuity.
2. There are too many subjects.
3. There is a lack of care in planning instruction.
4. Local help is generally untrained in public speaking, and by diffidence or mannerisms greatly hinders the attention of listeners.
5. Local help not prepared for the work.
6. Local help too well known in the community, and in nine out of ten cases charged with discrepancies between theory and practice.
7. Conductor hinders work by criticism upon predecessor.
8. Conductor sometimes obliged to do all the work, as help is often uncertain and incompetent.
9. Commissioners sometimes do not know how to make out a programme.

10. Help from Normal schools not good, as teachers must either neglect their own work in the Normal school or that of the institute. State Superintendent Draper found complaints among teachers that institute conductors lecture too much and allow no opportunity for expression of opinion nor discussion.

He said changes had been made, and he thought that the system was becoming more acceptable and more perfect. He considered the local help good, as it made teachers more tolerant. They found it not
