**Notes:**

1. **Period-appropriate script styles and letterforms:** The transcription reflects the cursive and flowing style typical of 19th-century handwriting, with elongated loops and connected letters.
   
2. **Common abbreviations and contractions:** Words like "act" for "act of," "duty" for "duty of," and "next" for "next year" are preserved as they appear in the document.

3. **Preserve exact spelling:** Even archaic spellings such as "Ruf" for "Ruff" and "McDonald" are transcribed exactly as written.

4. **Use [?] for uncertain characters or words:** Uncertain or unclear parts of the text are marked with [?].

5. **Note any corrections, insertions, or strikethroughs:** A [correction: ...] is noted where there appears to be a correction or alteration in the text.

6. **Identify different hands if multiple writers present:** The document appears to be written by a single hand, so no separate identification of different hands is necessary.

This transcription aims to provide an accurate representation of the original document, capturing its historical and stylistic nuances.
