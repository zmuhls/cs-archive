Mrs. Florence Hartman, Trustees.
Mr. G. R. Warren, Clerk.

The minutes of the regular meeting held on May 3, 1934, were read by the Clerk and no objections being noted were ordered adopted as read.

Mr. Jesse W. Smith appeared, requesting that the Board reconsider his dismissal. After some discussion the Chairman advised Mr. Smith that no action could be taken on his request until a full meeting of the Board could be held to deliberate before the matter could be taken up.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that the compensator had been installed on the electric motor in the High School building at a cost of $120.47 and that the New York Board of Fire Underwriters were to make a further inspection to approve the work.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that pursuant to resolution a rough survey of the cost of changing over the heating system in the grammar school building to connect it up to the boilers in the junior high school building had been made and that including architect and engineer's fees, etc., the project would cost in the neighborhood of $25,000.00. The Committee further stated that if the proposition was submitted to the voters at the August meeting the job could not get started until the following spring and therefore if the work is to be done the proposition should be submitted to the voters at the July meeting. The matter was laid on the table until the July meeting.
