The last fall in repairs the amount of public money received in April last, was $34.21. We employed Julia C. Grant in April last at public schools for week. The taught twenty four weeks amounting to $30.37 and $14.00 of this term was fixed with freblock money. The remainder $18.37 was raised and is to be raised in the district. In January last we informed A. T. Grant one of our trustees to pay him $9.50 for every twenty four days he taught. He kept the school nine weeks all of which we respectfully report.

Stamford, March 19th, 1838.
