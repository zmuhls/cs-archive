this State. Nearly half of these common school districts (1,132) do not operate schools, but contract with other districts for instruction of their children. The remaining common school districts contract with other types of districts for education of high school students. Some of the union free school districts and a few of the central districts also do not have high schools.

Many of the contract districts are clustered around cities and other large population centers and help com- plicate the school building problems of these areas.

In view of these facts, the Commission, with the co- operation of the State Education Department, completed a study of the problems which contract districts and non-resident pupils have created. It also studied the practical obstacles which have prevented enlargement of the city school districts.

The Commission found that localities, with the as- sistance of the State Education Department, have made good progress in eliminating small school districts. Since July 1, 1950, 265 union free and common school districts have been eliminated by local action, bringing the total number eliminated since 1915 to more than 7,000. Most of those eliminated in the past 18 months have been absorbed into 15 central districts, bringing the total of central districts to 424. However, much remains to be done.

In attempting to draw its 1947 Master Plan for com- pleting the centralization of rural schools, the Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System found areas adjacent to many cities and larger villages that did not readily fit into any proposed central school district and that, standing alone, could not provide an adequate educational program.

Since legal restrictions at that time precluded the annexation of school districts to most cities, the Master Plan attached the approximately 500 districts in these areas to 38 cities and marked them "left for future determination." For example, 62 districts were listed under Corning and 42 under Ithaca.

As a result of the new City School Law of 1950 and the Constitutional tax and debt limit amendments of 1949 and 1951, which gave fiscal independence and re- sponsibility to city school districts in cities of less than 125,000 population, it is now a simple matter legally to annex one or more contiguous districts to a city school district. However, because of practical reasons, only one of the approximately 500 districts referred to in the 1947 Master Plan has been annexed.

In its study, the Commission found these major factors retarding enlargement of the city districts:

1. Present State education aid provisions for con- tract districts and non-resident pupils and the resulting low tax rate in most of the contract districts make them unenthusiastic for change. The tax rates in the districts sending students to cities usually are $5 to $8 per $1,000 full valuation lower than the city school tax rates. At the same time, many city areas which have indicated an interest in annexing the city school district also have a fear that increased tax rates might result.

2. Under present conditions, contract districts and districts which send only high school pupils to other schools generally are not bearing their fair share of the cost of education. The receiving districts which build schools to accommodate non- resident pupils are taking all the risk for them are creating long-term debt to provide facilities for pupils who are being educated on annual or short term agreements.

3. Annexation of outside districts, under present cir- cumstances, often would operate to the disadvantage of the city because:

A. The city often would have to provide trans- portation for these pupils at local expense.

B. The education program and school facilities generally would have to be brought up to the city level.

C. Retention of rural teachers would require plac- ing them on city salary schedules. Over a period of years, this results in an increased cost per year of more than $1,000 for each teacher retained.

D. There are many one and two room schools in the districts adjacent to cities, which will have to be replaced.

E. The amount of real estate valuation per pupil in the 500 districts is generally much lower than in the cities.

F. By reorganization under present laws, city school districts generally would lose sub- stantial amounts of State aid.

As a result of these findings, the Commission is offering recommendations to the Legislature to expedite the reorganization of city school districts. (See Section V.)

Area Study in New York

New York City and other cities of the State face a major problem in bringing existing school buildings up to acceptable standards and in determining whether this can be accomplished best by rehabilitation or modernization.

Although this type of problem can be met gradually over the years, it cannot safely be postponed year after year. Its solution requires a systematic and orderly approach.

Because of the seriousness of this problem and the difficulty in developing standards and procedures for determining when a building should be modernized, rehabilitated or replaced, the Commission decided to make an intensive field study in a selected area.

The Commission enlisted the cooperation of the City of New York's Board of Education, Planning Commis- 23
