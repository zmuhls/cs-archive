247

The Clerk read communication of the Board of Assessors of the Town of Oyster Bay, dated August 14, 1904, advising that the assessed valuation of the school district for the year 1904-35 was $1,528,573.00.

The Clerk submitted the applications of George Harvey and Glenn Condon for the position of janitor. The President ordered that the applications be accepted and referred to the Building and Grounds Committee for consideration.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that the windows of the High School Building had been repaired.

The question of buying new shades for the High School Building was deliberated on but laid on the table for further consideration.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that the Chelisk Waterproofing Company had completed repairs to the auditorium walls and that they were apparently tight but that the roof still leaked and for that reason no action had been taken on the instructions to refinish the spots in the auditorium. After some discussion on the ways and means of repairing the roof the matter was left in the hands of the Building and Grounds Committee with authority to secure bids for the repairing of it.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that Mr. Ruff favored the employment of Arthur Walters as janitor and the Committee accordingly recommended his appointment at a salary of $120.00 per month. Mr. Case moved and Mr. Haab seconded the motion that Arthur Walters be appointed a janitor, effective September 7th, at a salary of $120.00 per month. This motion unanimously carried.

The Transportation Committee reported that Mr. Leigh had been asked to transport the pupils at the rate of $12.50 per day but that he had rejected the proposal. The Committee further reported that Mr. Leigh wanted $20.00 per day. At this point in the proceeding Mr. Leigh was consulted via the telephone and agreed to accept a rate of $18.00 per day. Mr. Kutcham moved and Mr. Haab seconded the motion that contract for the transportation of pupils for the current school year be awarded to Henry W. Leigh at the rate of $18.00 per day. This motion unanimously carried.

The Purchasing Committee reported that Montgomery & Company had been awarded an order for manual training hardware at $118.26 pursuant to resolution of the Board but that it had not been accepted as their bid was for $145.26.
