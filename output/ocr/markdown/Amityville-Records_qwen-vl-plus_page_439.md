Mr. C. R. Warren, Clerk.

Absent:

The minutes of the previous meetings were read and
approved.

The meeting was called to order in the Principal's
Office but as a large group of citizens interested in
the case of Mrs. Manda Gardiner were on hand to meet
with the Board, it was decided to hold the meeting in
the lunchroom.

The Clerk read resolution adopted at a previous
meeting of the Board, giving the reason for the
withholding of a contract from Mrs. Manda Gardiner.

Rev. Van Dyck and Mr. Carwoll, presented the Board's
side of the case. Mrs. Stuart Peterson noted as
spokesman for the group and at her suggestion Mrs.
Gardiner personally explain her side of the matter.
Mrs. Peterson requested that in consideration of Mrs.
Gardiner's thirteen years of service that the Board
re-consider the matter and tender her a contract.
Mr. Vogel moved that the Board re-consider the case
of Mrs. Gardiner and that a contract be offered for
the coming year.

Mrs. Peterson then asked if a petition signed by
several hundred persons would have any weight with
the Board. Rev. Van Dyck replied that it could not -
that as far as the Board was concerned the case was
closed.

As nothing further could be accomplished by a
prolonged debate the President declared the
discussion closed.

The Board then proceeded to the Principal's Office and
the regular meeting was resumed.
