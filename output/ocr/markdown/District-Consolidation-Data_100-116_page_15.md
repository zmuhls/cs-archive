**Notes:**
- The handwritten entry for "Harmony (#16)" and the date "5 October 1704*" appears to be an anomaly or error, as it predates the other entries by over a century and is likely a mislabeling or unrelated entry.
- The "No. of Pupils" column is filled only for the first five entries; the last entry has no number.
- The "REMARKS" column is blank for all entries.
