The Finance Committee referred invoice of Wesley Jackson for $55.70 to the Board for consideration and on motion duly made, seconded and carried, it was ordered paid.

The Finance Committee referred bill of the V. P. Moore Engineering Company for $204.00 to the Board and requested information concerning item of $120.00, which the Building Committee had not approved for payment. Mr. Vogel stated that it covered charge for rewinding motor and that the work had not been done satisfactory, as it had gone out of order within one week from the date of repairs. Mr. Vogel reported further that the balance of the bill totaling $84.00 was O. K. for payment. On motion made, duly seconded and carried, it was voted that the sum of $4.00 be paid, on receipt of a corrected invoice, properly sworn to, for that amount.
