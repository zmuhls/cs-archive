2. Rating Form for Elementary School Buildings—
It provides ratings for the various categories of
structural and educational facilities.

3. School Building Inventory Form—This was
developed in cooperation with the State Department
of Education to determine the condition of school
buildings. Copies were submitted to all schools
in the State, except in New York City.

4. Guide for Field Study—It utilizes the
professional skills of an educator, architect, and
technical inspector in the rating and screening of
school buildings.

5. Architect's Check List—To assist architects
in their rating of school buildings, this form was
developed with the assistance of the New York City
Planning Commission.

6. Building Inspection Report—This represents
the final arrangement of the rating form designed
for screening educational and building facilities
in New York City. It was developed in conjunction
with the New York City area study.

The New York Office also completed a Handbook
on Modernization and Rehabilitation, designed to help
communities determine whether it is feasible to
modernize or rehabilitate their school buildings.
Included in this handbook are a set of tentative
minimum acceptable standards for school building and
educational facilities; an estimate of unit costs,
developed in conjunction with Mr. Emil Schnidtlin, an
architect, findings and recommendations based on the
school building inventory form which was sent to school
officials throughout the Nation, and a selected,
annotated bibliography of the current literature on
modernization and rehabilitation of schools.

Unless the area study in New York City shows that
further work needs to be done on the tentative
standards and procedures, the Commission soon will
issue a technical report on the appraisal of capacity
and utilization of school buildings.
