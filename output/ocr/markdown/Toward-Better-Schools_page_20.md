struction required to reduce overcrowding. As a result, plant replacement or modernization projects have been moved up in priority.

As pointed out by the Education Management Survey, procedures have not yet been established to substantiate adequately the need for construction, or the order of need, especially where the questions of existing capacity, utilization and modernization or replacement are involved.

One of the major purposes of the Commission's area study, discussed later in this report, is to develop and refine such procedures.

Removing Site Problems

Site problems have been reduced to a minimum by adoption of the Commission's proposal that, in so far as determination of priorities permits, money for acquisition of sites be allocated sufficiently in advance to make possible clearance and preparation well ahead of construction.

No project in 1951 was deferred because of inability to clear a site. A dozen sites for buildings on the 1962 program already are available and the others are expected to be available as needed during the year. The problem of encumbered sites has been minimized by scheduling projects so that they are included in annual construction programs only when sites can be cleared within the year.

Conserving Critical Materials

During 1951, the school construction co-ordinator acted promptly in substituting reinforced concrete for structural steel and in curtailing the use of other critical materials. This action undoubtedly helped New York City to secure Federal authorizations to build and priorities to obtain material. For this and other reasons, the City of New York has had fewer difficulties in procuring critical materials than other school districts in the State.
