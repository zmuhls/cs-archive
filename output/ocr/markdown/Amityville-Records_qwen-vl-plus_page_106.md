The President read letter of the Associated School Boards and Trustees of the State of New York, dated January 19, 1893, calling to the attention of the Board the fact that Article 23-F of the Education Law provides minimum requirements as to starting salary and number and size of annual increments to teachers, supervisors, etc., and pointed out that salary increments cannot be avoided only by having [illegible] special legislation cano [illegible] by having c[illegible] special legislation declaring a moratorium on all mandatory increases. In view of the present financial conditions the Association asked that the Board vote on whether or not it should initiate legislation for a moratorium of one year for all employees, including teachers, of the State, county, town or city governments, and enclosed a ballot for use in expressing the sentiment of the Board members. After a general discussion on the proposition and on motion, it was voted that ballot be cast in favor of a one year moratorium on salary increases for all employees of the State, county, town and city governments and that such moratorium be permissive, not compulsory.

There being no further business the meeting thereupon adjourned.
