Date of Registry: ______________________
In Whose Name Registered: ______________
Signature of Clerk: ____________________

FURTHER RESOLVED, that except as herein modified the resolution
adopted by the Board of Education on the 19th day of October,
1931, is hereby ratified, approved and confirmed.

The question of the adoption of the foregoing resolution was
duly put to a vote which resolved as follows:

Ayes: Six
Nones: None

The President thereupon declared the resolution duly
adopted.

The Associated School Boards and Trustees of the State of
New York in a communication dated October 21, 1931 reported
that there was considerable objection to the present dates for
holding the annual meeting and recommended that some date
during the month of June he designated and made uniform for all
districts and asked that the Board of Education record its
wishes on a ballot furnished for that purpose.
