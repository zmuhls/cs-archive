population, private and parochial school growth.
A special census should be made, if necessary.

3. Make special area studies of these factors as a basis for the assumptions or judgments involved in estimation of future enrollment.

4. Use a tested method of forecasting enrollment on the basis of this information.

5. Exercise care in the interpretation and use of enrollment estimates, being careful to identify temporary increases and avoid over-estimation.

6. Adopt policies and standards relative to type, size, design, construction and cost of any new or additional facilities.

7. Adopt policies and take steps to handle peak or temporary enrollment increases.

8. Determine what additional facilities are required to house the probable long-range enrollment in the area.

9. Make plans for converting new facilities to other uses in the event of error in the long range estimate.

Other studies which should provide helpful guidance on this problem are under way.

Enlarging School Districts

Experience throughout the State has demonstrated that large school districts offer the best opportunities to achieve maximum utilization of school buildings, greatest economy in construction costs, ability to adjust facilities to the fluctuations of school enrollments and most effective use of local borrowing and taxing power.

However, there are 2,295 small common school districts still numbered among the 3,143 school districts in this State. Nearly half of these common school districts (1,132) do not operate schools, but contract with other types of districts for instruction of their children. The remaining common school districts contract with other types of districts for education of high school students. Some of the union free school districts and a few of the central districts also do not have high schools.

Many of the contract districts are clustered around cities and other large population centers and help complicate the school building problems of these areas.

In view of these facts, the Commission, with the cooperation of the State Education Department, completed a study of the problems which contract districts and non-resident pupils have created. It also studied the practical obstacles which have prevented enlargement of the city school districts.

The Commission found that localities, with the assistance of the State Education Department, have made good progress in eliminating small school districts. Since July 1, 1956, 265 union free and common school districts have been eliminated by local action, bringing the total number eliminated since 1915 to more than 7,000. Most of those eliminated in the past 18 months were absorbed into 15 central districts, bringing the total of central districts to 424. However, much remains to be done.

In attempting to draw up its 1947 Master Plan for completing the centralization of rural schools, the Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System found areas adjacent to many cities and larger villages that did not readily fit into any proposed central school district and that, standing alone, could not provide an adequate educational program.

Since legal restrictions at that time precluded the annexation of school districts to most cities, the Master Plan attached the approximately 500 districts referred to in the 1947 Master Plan to 38 cities and marked them "left for future determination." For example, 62 districts were listed under Corning and 42 under Ithaca.

As a result of the new City School Law of 1950 and the Constitutional tax and debt limit amendments of 1949 and 1951, which gave local independence and responsibility to city school districts in cities of less than 125,000 population, it is now a simple matter legally to annex one or more contiguous districts to a city school district. However, because of practical reasons, only one of the approximately 500 districts referred to in the 1947 Master Plan has been annexed.

In its study, the Commission found these major factors retarding enlargement of the city districts:

1. Present State education aid provisions for contract districts and non-resident pupils and the resulting low tax rate in most of the contract districts make them unenthusiastic about change. The tax rates in the districts sending students to cities usually are $3 to $6 per $1,000 full valuation lower than the city school tax rates. At the same time, many city areas which have indicated an interest in enlarging the city school district also have a fear that increased tax rates might result.

2. Under present conditions, contract districts and districts which send only high school pupils to other schools generally are not bearing their fair share of the cost of education. The receiving districts which build schools to accommodate non-resident pupils are taking all of the risk for they are creating long-term debt to provide facilities for pupils who are being educated on an annual or short-term agreements.

3. Annexation of outside districts, under present circumstances, often would operate to the disadvantage of the city because:

A. The city often would have to provide transportation for these pupils at local expense.

B. The education program and school facilities generally would have to be brought up to the city level.
