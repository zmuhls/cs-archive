**Notes:**

* The table is structured with columns for "No. of Unit," "NAME OF TOWN," "DATE OF SCHOOL MEETING - ORGANIZING DISTRICT -," "DATE ON WHICH PAPERS WERE APPROVED AT DEPARTMENT," "No. of dists. included," and "REMARKS."
* The "DATE OF SCHOOL MEETING" and "DATE ON WHICH PAPERS WERE APPROVED" columns are further divided into "Day," "Month," and "Year."
* The "No. of dists. included" column lists the specific districts included in each unit.
* The "REMARKS" column is blank for both entries.
* The document appears to be a form with pre-printed text and handwritten entries for the "NAME OF TOWN" and "No. of dists. included" columns.
* The page number "65" is visible in the top right corner.
