Are We
Cheating Our Children?

by giving them educational tools inferior to those we enjoyed.

Successive waves of war and postwar systems lagging at least two decades behind needed—and neglected—construction.

YOUR COMMUNITY IS IN TROUBLE.
Every community is heading for the gravest crisis the United States has ever faced. Unless measures are taken to cope with the actual short of actual war, unless we can provide educational facilities adequate to the needs of our children, we will be faced with a situation that will be as serious as the traffic jams in secondary schools that have been caused by the postwar babies. The postwar babies are deluging public schools at least two decades behind construction. Few schools have been built since the last war, and the few that have been built have been behind the needs of the community. In the early depression-ridden 1930s, few schools were built during the new school construction period. In the 1940s, the war effort took priority on materials for school construction. In the 1950s, the postwar babies are deluging public schools at least two decades behind construction.

Few schools have been built since the last war, and the few that have been built have been behind the needs of the community.

The bald facts in the case are as follows: The United States is producing children about three times faster than we are providing educational facilities for them. It must come as a shock to learn that hundreds of thousands of kids are attending schools in tents, sheds, basements, stores, churches, garages, trailers, and other makeshift facilities. The structure of our public education, already sagging under the impact of the postwar babies, is now in danger of collapsing completely. The money is so desperately needed in the public schools that the financial considerations are no longer a question of whether we can afford to build new schools, but whether we can afford to keep the schools we have.

The money is so desperately needed in the public schools that the financial considerations are no longer a question of whether we can afford to build new schools, but whether we can afford to keep the schools we have.

The worst crisis in our public schools can be predicted as a direct result of the postwar babies. There were 3,900,000 children born in the United States in 1951. We have an astronomical chart of the courses of events that will be faced by the United States in the next seven years. We will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events. If we do not build these classrooms, we will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events. If we do not build these classrooms, we will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events. If we do not build these classrooms, we will have to build 600,000 classrooms in the next seven years to maintain the natural course of events.
