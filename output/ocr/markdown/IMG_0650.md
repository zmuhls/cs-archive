New York State Teachers' Association

Second, the new law distributes this money on an equitable basis, first, by determining the number of pupils in the community; and second, by determining the wealth of each community on the basis of the full valuation of real property. The State sets a minimum educational program which each community must reach. In return, it guarantees each community enough money to meet this requirement if the community makes a fair contribution toward it.

Third, under the old Cole law the State provided $1,200 for each cost unit in elementary schools, and $1,600 for each cost unit in secondary schools. Under the new law these amounts are raised to $1,500 and $1,900 respectively in all schools having more than five teachers. For schools having two, three, and four teachers, an additional quota of $200 a year is provided.

Fourth, the law is sound, in that it provides for the gradual raising of the standard of education by requiring all communities of the State to reach a higher minimum expenditure per pupil, and secondly, by distributing the cost of the State's minimum program of education upon all communities in proportion to their ability to pay taxes. This applies to the smallest and poorest community, as well as to the largest and wealthiest in the State. New York City gets no more and no less on this basis than any other community in the State.

RETIREMENT LAW AMENDMENTS

Several important amendments to the Retirement Law were passed last winter.

One of these provides that leave of absence with pay may be considered "service" under regulations prescribed by the Retirement Board. Under the original law, this was not the case. The amendment is to the advantage of the teacher, since it may happen that leave of absence may need to be counted to make up the years necessary either for disability or superannuated retirement. In case this time is not so needed, it is not necessary to include it; and, therefore, the teacher's average annual salary is not affected by the smaller amount of pay received during leave of absence, when the retirement allowance is being determined.

A second amendment provides that the teacher who is absent from school duties for more than two years because of serious illness, but who has not had sufficient service to retire because of disability—for example, a total of thirteen years—will not automatically lose her membership in the system, but upon application to the Retirement Board will be continued indefinitely as a member, or until such time as her health recovers.
