## Transcription

The Commission offers these recommendations to districts operating high schools:

1. Discontinue practices which give a local tax rate advantage to the districts which contract for education of their children.

2. Charge tuition at least sufficient to cover all the cost of instructing the pupils from a contracting district.

3. Do not build new schools for pupils from contract districts, but rather insist that these districts become part of the tax district operating the high school.

Districts which do not operate high schools should not expect the operating districts or the taxpayers of the State, through State education aid, to give them an advantage in payment of taxes for support of schools. Such districts should consolidate with the district operating the high school and bear a fair share of the cost.
