The Clerk read the minutes of the regular meeting held on April 5, 1934, and no objections being noted were ordered adopted as read.

The Clerk submitted communication of Simion S. Pye making application for the position of assistant janitor. Mrs. Hartman moved and Mr. Axtell seconded the motion that the communication be received and placed on file. This motion unanimously carried.

The Clerk also submitted communication of George A. Brown who advised that as a public school pensioner the law dis-qualified him from accepting remuneration as a census taker and that accordingly he would not be a candidate for that office. Mr. Brown further thanked the Board for the many courtesies extended him through the many years. The communication was ordered accepted and placed on file.

Mr. John Styles appeared before the Board and submitted a bid of $120.37 for installing on the electric motor in the High School building a compensator with a no voltage release. The Building and Grounds Committee reported that the New York Board of Fire Underwriters had written requesting this work be done. The proposition was left in the hands of the Building and Grounds Committee for investigation.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that the Obelisk Waterproofing Company was installing copper caps to the parapets and doing other work to stop the leaks in the High School Building.
