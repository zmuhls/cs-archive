NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

"The Teacher's Reward."

DAVENPORT, Iowa, April 17, 1897.

JOHN T. NICHOLSON, Esquire

I have been glad to observe, in late years, how much the New York State and city schools are doing to teach the children the good lessons of any patriotism. They learn to be the good citizens of any country. They learn to love their country just as much as their local baseball club; and the former affection is lasting. It is one of the cheering things on the part of our teachers that they are quick to catch the infection of any enthusiasm. Children are quick to catch the infection of any enthusiasm. They learn to be the good citizens of any country. They learn to love their country just as much as their local baseball club; and the former affection is lasting.
