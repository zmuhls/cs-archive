Proceedings of the

"The Ignorance and Incapacity of Schoolmasters." In this oration he advocated the establishment of an "Academy for Schoolmasters." The idea continued to grow abroad as well as at home. Dr. Barnard affirms that to Mr. Carter, who is sometimes called the "Father of Normal Schools" in this country, more than to any other one person belongs the credit of having arrested the leading minds of Massachusetts to the necessity of the immediate and thorough improvement in the system of free schools, and of having clearly pointed out the most direct and thorough mode of procuring this improvement by providing for the training of competent teachers for these schools.

Mr. Carter was a member of the Massachusetts Legislature and chairman of the Committee on Education. This position made it possible for him to do much toward creating a public opinion in favor of normal schools in Massachusetts, which resulted in the Normal School Act of 1839 in that State.

The movement in favor of normal schools was greatly aided by the letters published in the Connecticut Observer, a newspaper printed in Hartford, from the pen of the Rev. Thomas Gallaudet. These letters favored the project of professional training of teachers, and proposed methods of anticipating difficulties.

Other States took up the idea—as Pennsylvania, Tennessee and far off Missouri. As early as 1826, Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York, in his annual message to the Legislature of the State, strongly recommended the establishment of a seminary for the training of teachers.

It is said that the first practical work of a professional nature in this country was done by Samuel B. Hall, at Concord, Vt, where he opened a school for the training of teachers.

The first regular normal school, however, in America was the one established at Lexington, Mass, under the Act of 1839, already mentioned. This school received the hearty endorsement and able assistance of Horace Mann, who had just been appointed secretary of the recently established Board of Education. The enterprise might not have been successful had it not received the aid of its brilliant talents and untiring devotion on the 3rd of July, 1839, with three pupils, and Cyrus Pierce as principal. The school was organized entirely fitting that a school of this character, whose purpose is to prepare teachers the better for their great work of training good citizens, should have deeds of those who sealed their devotion to free institutions with their blood. It took a strong man to meet the difficulties incident to the lodgment of a new idea in the public mind. The cause of normal schools in this country on such suggestive a day and in a place hallowed by the blood of those who sealed their devotion to free institutions with their blood. It took a strong man to meet the difficulties incident to the lodgment of a new idea in the public mind. The cause of normal schools in this country may be inferred from the fact that it is still in existence on Framingham, which place much owes to Principal Pierce. That placed still in existence on Framingham, which place much owes to Principal Pierce. That placed still in existence on Framingham, which place much owes to Principal Pierce.
