The President stated that a petition had been received from a group of parents requesting that on account of the discontinuance of the bus service and in view of the necessity for providing some kind of transportation for the younger children living in localities too far to walk that a special meeting be held as soon as possible to discuss the matter.

This motion was unanimously carried.
