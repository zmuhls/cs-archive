**Problems Created by the National Emergency**

The rapidly expanding defense effort of the United States has made it increasingly difficult to obtain critical materials for construction of urgently needed school buildings. Recognizing the tremendous problem that this posed for the school districts individually, the Commission directed its staff to exert every effort to assist in overcoming this major obstacle.

The United States Office of Education required school districts to apply directly for allocation of critical materials and did not assign priorities on a state-wide basis. Therefore, the Commission did not use standby legislation under which the State Defense Council could assign priorities to school buildings and channel applications for Federal allocations of material.

Early in the year, the Commission asked its staff to begin studies of the possibility of reducing the use of steel, copper and aluminum in school construction. Beginning in September, 1951, the Commission issued a series of Information Bulletins showing how these scarce materials could be conserved. The bulletins were distributed to architects and school authorities throughout the State.

This pioneer effort to conserve critical materials drew commendation at a Congressional hearing in Washington and elsewhere in the Nation. Subsequently, the Commission sent bulletins upon request to many architects, educators and construction men in other states.

Last April, with the co-operation of the State Education Department, the Commission made a survey to determine to what extent school construction was being delayed by material shortages. It found that about 20 per cent of the buildings under construction were encountering shortages which could delay occupancy of the buildings. Most of the delays were caused by lack of structural steel.

Federal authorities immediately were contacted in an effort to expedite the flow of materials to the school districts. In the meantime, the National Production Authority's controlled materials plan was placed in operation. Under this plan, school districts applied to the U.S. Office of Education in the Federal Security Agency for authorization to build and for an allocation of the steel, copper, or aluminum allotted to schools by NPA.

For the last three months of 1951 and first quarter of 1952, the National Production Authority allotted to school construction less than half the amount of steel requested.

Through staff contacts with Federal authorities and the Chairman's personal conversations with the head of NPA, the Commission strongly urged better allocation of critical materials for urgently needed school buildings.

Although the NPA has increased the amount of steel allowed for schools, the total still is far below estimates of requirements based upon local requests to the U.S. Office of Education and it is anticipated that material shortages will remain a major problem for the Commission during the period ahead.

In view of the relatively small amount of steel made available for school construction in the nation, the Commission recommended to the U.S. Office of Education a more thorough screening of applications from various school districts in this and other states.

After analyzing the Federal agency's methods of determining which school projects should receive the available steel, the Commission urged several means of tightening the screening process so that applications could more accurately be assigned priority on the basis of urgency and approval could be withheld from projects until a maximum effort to conserve critical materials for determination.

The Commission's suggestions were adopted by the U.S. Office of Education. As a result, a new application form, requiring more specific information for determination, was introduced.
