I. Meeting the

The New York State Commission on School Buildings was created by the 1950 Legislature to help the localities meet their emergency and long-range needs for public school buildings.

The Commission was established upon the recommendation of the Moore Committee on Constitutional Tax and Debt Limitations after that Committee, at the request of the Governor and the State Education Commission, had considered various reports of school building needs and proposals to finance those needs.

The Moore Committee determined that a huge State bond issue for school construction was not necessary and that, with the aid of informed guidance and modernization of local taxing and borrowing powers, most of the State's school districts could meet school construction needs for a number of years with their own resources.

In compliance with the Legislature's direction, this Commission has attacked school construction problems from every angle.

Causes of the Problem

Public concern about the need for new school buildings and the financial ability of localities to construct them had been aroused by the large number of births in postwar years. The average was more than 300,000 a year between 1946 and 1951.

However, the Commission's study has disclosed that most of the school building problems to date have not been caused by increased births alone. Elementary school enrollments for the 1951-52 school year generally are no higher than in 1936-37. There still are more than 100,000 fewer children in elementary schools than during the peak year of 1931-32. The postwar births will not raise elementary school enrollments to a record high until sometime during the next six years. High school enrollments generally are at the lowest level reported in 20 years.
