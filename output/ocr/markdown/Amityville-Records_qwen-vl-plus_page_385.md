On motion duly made, seconded and carried, it was voted that a suitable community tree be erected on the High School grounds.

Mr. Lawrence Coit, Attorney at Law, appeared before the Board relative to whether or not it would be feasible to bring before the people at the District Meeting to be held on August 3rd, the proposition "Shall the Board of Education be authorized to rent out the auditorium of the High School." Mr. Coit stated that it would be contrary to the State Law to adopt such a resolution and that he therefore did not recommend it.
