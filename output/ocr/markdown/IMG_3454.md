Facilities Throughout Nation Lag, Survey Finds—Many of Buildings Held Absolte

Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 — A current deficit of more than 325,000 schoolrooms in this country was revealed in the second progress report of the school facilities survey, made public today by the Office of Education.

Simultaneously, survey experts gave an "arm-chair estimate" of a long-range shortage of another 275,000 rooms by 1960, bringing the total deficit up to 600,000 by that time. The long-range phase of the survey will not be completed for another year.

The estimated cost of building the schoolrooms now needed is $10,700,000,000. But under their existing laws, the states and territories could buy only $5,800,000,000 worth of school housing, the report stated.

Earl James McGrath, United States Commissioner of Education, said that a deficit of $4,900,000,000 thus stood in the way of enough school facilities for American boys and girls.

At a press conference held in connection with the release of the report, Commissioner McGrath said that in his judgment the report had given the American public the first factual comprehensive data on the schoolhouse situation. He added that it had been found to be even more serious than expected.
