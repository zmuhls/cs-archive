Moved, seconded and carried, that the bid of Wilbur F. Heinley for supplying the coal requirements for the School year 1928-29 be accepted.

The President called for bids for the repairing of the defective plaster of the interior of the High School Building. No bids were received.

The Clerk read communication of Samuel T. Haff, Contractor, with reference to the reshingling of the old portion of the grammar school building. Mr. Haff reported that the dormers in said roof were in a very bad condition and that to make a perfect roof that said dormers should be replaced with new wood and submitted a bid of $373.00 for placing the dormers in perfect condition.

Motion made, duly seconded and carried, that the bid for additional work to the contract of Samuel T. Haff for re-roofing part of the grammar school building be and be hereby accepted.

The Clerk read letter of the Johns-Manville Company recommending the substitution of Super Class A Flashing in the gutters of the grammar school building, in place of copper as ordered in the original specifications.

Motion made, duly seconded and carried, authorizing a change in the contract form with Samuel T. Haff for re-roofing of the grammar school building, so that Super Class A Flashing for gutters with a twenty year guarantee be used, in place of copper gutters which were without guarantee.

Mr. C. Earle Vrooman and Mr. George H. Webster reported that pursuant to understanding with Ruff, they were due two weeks salary for teaching summer school. Motion made, duly seconded and carried, authorizing the Clerk to draw checks to them accordingly at the rate of $25.00 per week and to pay them on presentation of properly sworn invoices.

A discussion ensued at this time in regard to the defective plaster situation and the President suggested that the Building Committee withdraw from handling the proposition and that he be authorized to appoint a special Committee to take over the matter. The President stated that this action was necessitated by the fact that no bids had been received for the work although advertisement had been made therefore. Mr. Vogel, Chairman of the Building Committee agreed to the suggestion of the President and on motion duly made, seconded and carried, the President was authorized to appoint a special committee to give out a contract on a cost plus basis, for the repairing of the defective plaster of the high school building, on the best obtainable guarantee.
