Mr. Nelson V. W. Colyer appeared before the Board and reported that the contingent liability insurance policy contained a property damage clause which he did not believe was required. After a discussion of the matter it was the unanimous opinion that the policy be accepted without this endorsement and Mr. Colyer so instructed.

Mr. Percy L. Hall, together with Mr. George N. Fawett, appeared before the Board and asked that when the times arrive to place fire insurance on the new school building that they be given consideration. Letter of Mr. Fawett on this matter was also moved, seconded and carried, that it be acknowledged and placed on file.

On the question of renting an additional outside classroom for the balance of the current school year, Mr. Ruff recommended that three of the lower grades classes be consolidated into two by giving double promotions to a small group of pupils and stated that while this would give probably more than 35 pupils each and that while this number is not desirable, it would relieve the Board of renting an outside classroom for one semester and save approximately $750.00 for rental, alterations and equipment plus another $800.00 for an additional teacher. On motion the consolidation plan recommended by Mr. Ruff was approved.

It was moved, seconded and carried, that the Purchasing Committee be authorized to purchase one hundred and eighty three (183) lockers together with suitable locks for the girls locker and shower rooms, at a cost of approximately $550.00.

It was moved, seconded and carried, that dark shades be purchased for the High School laboratory room.

Mrs. James Richards of Massapequa on behalf of the Amitville Village Players requested the use of the High School Auditorium for a play to be given for the benefit of the unemployed on Saturday, February 6th. Moved, seconded and carried, that the request be granted.

The Teachers Committee reported no unexcusable absences for the month of December but that Mrs. Dayton was entitled to one days salary for substitute teaching. On motion the reports was ordered accepted and placed on file and the substitute teacher directed to be paid.

It was moved, seconded and carried, that effective the close of the current semester the resignation of Miss Prisolla Perley be accepted and that she accordingly be released from her contract for the balance of the school year.
