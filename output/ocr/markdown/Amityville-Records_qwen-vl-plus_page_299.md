and set forth the reasons prompting such a request. After some discussion on the matter, Mrs. Hartman moved and Mr. Ketcham seconded the motion of the Village Board that at the request of the Trustees that the sum of $2,500.00 be included in the 1935-36 budget for the Amityville Free Public Library, subject to the ratification and approval of the voters at the annual district meeting. This motion unanimously carried.

The Board at this time prepared a budget for the coming school year. Mrs. Arrell moved and Mr. Ketcham seconded the motion that the following budget of expenses for the current school year and that the Clerk be directed to cause the same to be published in both local newspapers as provided by law, this motion unanimously carried.
