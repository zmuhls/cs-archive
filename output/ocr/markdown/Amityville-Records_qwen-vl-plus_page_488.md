Mr Arthur W. Ruff -2-

There seems to be authority for such use in subdivision
1 of section 455 of the Education Law. In our opinion
there is a decided difference between granting the use to
persons who wish to receive instruction and granting the
use to a person who desires to give instruction for his
own gain. I do not think that the latter can be justi-
fied under any provision of the Education Law.

Where the board, itself, employs instructors
they must be regularly licensed teachers in order
to receive compensation from the public or from district
funds.

Trusting I have made these distinctions clear
to you, I am

Very truly yours

E/H

Irwin Esmond
