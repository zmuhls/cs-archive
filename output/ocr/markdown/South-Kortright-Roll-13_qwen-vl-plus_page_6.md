**Notes:**

1. **Period-appropriate script styles and letterforms:** The transcription reflects the cursive and flowing style typical of 19th-century handwriting, including ligatures and extended tails on certain letters.

2. **Common abbreviations and contractions of the era:** 
   - "M[.]" likely stands for "Mr." or "Mister."
   - "No." is used for "Number."
   - "Shall" is written as "shall" but in a cursive form.
   - "Voted" is used multiple times, indicating formal decision-making.

3. **Preserve exact spelling even if archaic:** 
   - "Shall" is used instead of "will."
   - "Proportion" is spelled as "proportion."
   - "Moderator" is spelled as "Moderator."
   - "Trustees" is spelled as "trustees."

4. **Use [?] for uncertain characters or words:** 
   - The word following "held at the school in" is illegible and marked as "[illegible]."
   - The name following "Duncan" is unclear and marked as "[illegible]."

5. **Note any corrections, insertions, or strikethroughs as [correction: ...]:** 
   - There are no visible corrections, insertions, or strikethroughs in the provided text.

6. **Identify different hands if multiple writers present as [different hand: ...]:**
