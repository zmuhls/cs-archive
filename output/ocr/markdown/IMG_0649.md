The New York State Teachers' Association

WHAT IS A PROFESSIONAL TEACHER?

ONE who is interested in her profession as well as in her "job"; who helps to raise and maintain the conditions of school service. Standards of preparation and pay, and to improve the systems of support and control of schools don't just happen to exist. School laws affecting almost every phase of teaching work don't come like the rain. The overhead of carnet and persistent effort ining a profession is the product of carnet and persistent effort. Group benefits demand group service. Every teacher and fort. Group benefits demand group service. Every teacher and receives benefits from others' service to the profession and to each other's benefits. Not each for each, but each for all and all for each is the professional spirit.

WHAT THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR

Our Association was largely instrumental in securing the passage of the so-called Dick-Rice Law. This is one of the most important pieces of educational legislation in recent years.

First, the new law provides for additional State aid for schools by extending the principle of the Cole Law passed two years ago. The amount of this additional State aid is $16,500,000 in 1927, and increases approximately five additional millions in each year for the next three, amounting in 1930 to about $32,000,000.
