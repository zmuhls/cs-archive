The meeting was called to order by Mr. Vogel, Vice-President, who presided in the absence of the President.

Mr. Vogel stated that the meeting had been called to consider and receive report of the Building Committee.

The Building Committee reported that it had been unable to secure bids for the repairing of the high school auditorium ceiling, from any of the local plasterers but that it had been able to secure a bid for the installation of a metal ceiling.

Mr. J. T. Zoglowek of 184 Juanita Avenue, Freeport, N. Y., appeared before the Board and submitted a bid of $850.00 for a metal ceiling for the high school auditorium, which would include erection and a finish of two coats of paint. Mr. Zoglowek offered to metal the side walls at a cost of $125.00 additional and for repairing the walls where necessary $25.00 would be required. Mr. Zoglowek also bid on painting the walls of the auditorium, consisting of two flat coats of enamel (to be furnished by Board) at a cost of $890.00 or if only two flat coats were desired the price would be $189.00. No action was taken on these bids.

There being no further business, the meeting thereupon adjourned.
