At an annual Meeting held at the Schoolhouse in School district, S. 2, in the town of Stamford on the 18th day of March 1834 pursuant to a public notice William Reel was chosen Moderator Voted that Duncan M. McDonald be District Clerk Voted that Novatus Bliss Win Footes & Cabey Barlow be trustees Voted that Luther Taylor be Collector Voted that $12.00 of the public Money be applied on the Summer School Voted that the bylaws stand as they did last year are ever since the year 1824 Not[e] that this Meeting be adjourned to the 3rd Tuesday of March next

D. M. McDonald Clerk
Wm. Reel Moderator

[correction: Not[e] that this Meeting be adjourned to the 3rd Tuesday of March next] (original has "Not[e] that this Meeting be adjourned to the 3rd Tuesday of March next" with "Not[e]" slightly altered or emphasized)

Note: The handwriting appears to be in a consistent cursive style typical of the early 19th century, with some letters showing characteristic flourishes and loops. The abbreviation "S." for "School" is common in this era. The use of "M." for "McDonald" and "Wm." for "William" are also typical contractions of the time. The spelling of "Summer" as "Summer" and "bylaws" as "bylaws" is preserved as written, reflecting the archaic spelling conventions of the period. The signature "D. M. McDonald Clerk" is clearly written, and the name "Wm. Reel Moderator" is also distinct. The correction noted suggests a possible emphasis or alteration in the original document.
