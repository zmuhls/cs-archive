II. Summary of Progress in 1951

Finance

The ability of our localities to finance their necessary school building construction was strengthened by the voters of the State when they overwhelmingly approved at the November, 1951, election a Constitutional amendment revising the limitations on borrowing power.

The amendment was proposed by the Moore Committee on Tax and Debt Limits after a long and thorough study of the Constitutional provisions affecting municipal and school district borrowing power. The amendment was designed to relate Constitutional debt limitations more accurately to the localities' ability to pay.

Major provisions of this amendment, effective January 1, 1952, change the debt limit base from assessed valuation to full valuation, create separate debt limits for cities under 125,000 population and school districts in these cities, and expand the borrowing power of New York City.

Meanwhile, through amendment to existing laws, the Legislature has modernized the debt limitations imposed on other school districts in the State and better equipped them to use their own resources in providing the school buildings that are needed, now or in the future. (See Second Report of the Commission, Pages: 32-34, 36)

The 1951 Legislature also continued for another year the program of emergency State advances to school districts which do not have sufficient local resources to pay all the debt service on bonds issued for essential school construction. A resume of the operation of this program is contained in a subsequent section of this report.

The change to full valuation as the debt limit base for localities has placed increased emphasis on the importance of the State equalization rates which are used to compute a locality's full valuation.

However, recognizing the close relationship between State education aid and the financial ability of local school districts, the Commission believes the establishment of new State equalization rates will make necessary a thorough review of the present formula for distribution of education aid.

New Construction

Areas with critical school building problems made substantial progress in school construction during the year.

Outside of New York City, 62 school districts reported that overcrowding has curtailed school sessions in the current year. Nearly all of these districts are in the critical areas listed in the Commission's second report. Most of them are located in Nassau, Suffolk, and Erie Counties.

In the 62 districts, there are 101 school buildings with curtailed programs for one or more grades. Half of these buildings (53) are in Nassau County. Suffolk reports 15 and Erie, eight.

However, almost all of these districts have vigorously attacked the problem and have taken corrective steps. Bond issues were voted down in three. Six others have taken no action but one of these is a new central district, another is about to vote on centralization, and a third is considering centralization.
