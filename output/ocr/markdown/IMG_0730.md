ADDRESS OF WELCOME.

The following address of welcome was delivered by Hon. Richard L. Hand, of Elizabethtown:

MR. PRESIDENT AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION.—The honorable and pleasant duty of welcoming you to our modest village has been assigned to me, and, in behalf of all our citizens, I now gladly bid you welcome.

No splendid halls, no vast library or famous seat of learning has attracted you to this place of meeting. Only the pure sweet air, amber water and stately hills—

"The power, the beauty and the majesty
That have their haunts in dale, or pine mountain,
Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring"—

have led you to assemble here, where towering summits of our grand mountains may suggest high aims and lofty thoughts; their adamanite sides teach the dignity of stable purpose and repose of character, and the sweet peace of this alpine valley illustrate the worth of thankful content—may show the emptiness of noise and display, the bitterness of strife.

While we can offer neither triumphs of architecture nor applauding thousands—nothing beyond the simplest facilities for your use—yet we know that you will rejoice in the beauty of our surroundings and your hearts will hold sweet communings with nature, growing stronger and happier in the companionship of these encircling mountains, which I, who have passed my life within their guardianship, have never known to wear a frown.

But, however humble and simple may be the welcome which is ours to offer, be assured that it is heartfelt, because we hold you in especial honor.
