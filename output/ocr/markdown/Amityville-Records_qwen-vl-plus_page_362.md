The District Meeting having adjourned, the Clerk proceeded to record the minutes of the meeting held inst. [illegible] thereon.

On motion duly made, seconded and carried, the report was accepted and it was voted to offer contracts to the bidders as proposed.

On recommendation of the Building Committee it was voted to emend the report of $1000.00 on equipment which was voted out when the District rented a room on Grove Avenue on which had been later transferred to other equipment in the new school.

On motion duly made, seconded and carried, it was resolved that the Trustees be empowered to appoint Officers for the Washington Trip.

On motion duly made, seconded and carried, it was voted that the Clerk write Juniors Elmerose Lloyd and Jerome T. Smith, that it is the duty of the Trustees to take care of the side-walks in case of a storm and that their action in not being done during the recent storms is not with disfavor by the Board and that further omission to do their proper duty will result in their dismission.

There being no further business, the meeting therefore adjourned.
