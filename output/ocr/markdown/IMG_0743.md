theories they had been spending their treasure and blood in
resisting tyranny, until by force of circumstances their
government organization became a republic. To such a people, the
mental organization of Puritans, with Pastor John Robinson at its
head, fled from England for shelter before drifting upon Plymouth
Rock. From this people came the first settlers in a village which
for obvious reasons, they called New Amsterdam, in a territory
they called New Netherland.

It would be strange indeed if they had not proved to be an
industrious and thrifty people, as it would be equally strange if
they had not brought with them a love for liberty and an instinct
for self-government. Sturdy in body and mind, and in figure,
tolerant in spirit, given to trade and to the accumulation of
property; they cut the forest, tilled the ground, built huts,
opened shops, trafficked with the Indians, while they organized
society, established public worship, opened schools and erected
all the institutions of a civil state. In the most forbidding
circumstances and contending with the strongest odds, they
impressed their ways and their beliefs upon the future history of
the country.

THE DUTCH ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS.

Our colonial records clearly show that in the midst of the most
overwhelming difficulties, they were not indifferent to the
importance of schools, for even in their most important documents,
the affairs of the schools receive frequent mention. Their
primitive and crude ideas, their difficulties in raising money and
regulating teachers, the way in which they made great contentions
out of insignificant matters, would be ludicrous if not so common
in the closing years of the nineteenth century.

In 1621 the States-General of Holland enjoined the colony
"to find speedy means to maintain a clergyman and a schoolmaster,"
and it was required that "each householder and inhabitant
should bear such tax and public charge as should be considered
proper for their maintenance." Four years later the expenses of
the schoolmaster are shown to have been 360 florins, just one-
fourteenth of those of the minister. You observe that some
pernicious ideas relate back to very early precedent. In 1633 Adam
Roe[?]landson, a professional schoolmaster, was brought over to
take charge of the school. He remained in charge for nine years,
and charge, and is believed to have been the first professional
schoolmaster in the country. Unfortunately the proof is abundant
that he was of a quarrelsome nature and no credit to the profession.
Before 1650, New Amsterdam had a population of 800. Jan
Cornelisen, Jan Stevenson and Aryaen Janson are mentioned as
teachers who kept schools "in hired houses," and they were in
part, at least, set apart to pay teachers, and they were in part,
at least, set apart to pay teachers, and they were in part, at
least, set apart to pay teachers. One of the reports of the board
paid out of the public treasury. One of the reports of the board
of accounts of New Netherland estimates that the expense for the
next year of the "schoolmaster, preceptor and sexton" will be
thirty florins, or about twelve dollars and thirty cents per month.
