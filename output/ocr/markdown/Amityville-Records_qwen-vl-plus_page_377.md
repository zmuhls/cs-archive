Principal's Office, May 6, 1926

I am here making the usual appeal to the Board of Education and to the parents of the members of the high school commencement class. I suppose it will be a case of "Ailing Flying in the Wilderness". The one thing the American people in its and rush will not brook is any limitation placed upon their spending money for pleasure and show. It is "thumbed down" for the man who stands in the way of their plethera of spending money.

Our young people have inherited this tendency from our generation and have gone 100% better. If our graduating class is not curbed, they will be likely to use Commencement as an opportunity for show, produced by a lavish expenditure. It gives the sweet girl graduate several fine opportunities for the expenditure of money:

1. The Washington trip
2. A fine new gown for Class Day
3. A fine new gown for Commencement
4. A fine new gown for the Reception
5. She may participate liberally in a high priced orchestra travelling a distance of A kindred union or $0, and several other opportunity.
6. She takes literally the advice of the Stratford bard, "Costly thy habit as thy purse can Buy".

Unless wholesome advice is offered to or, if necessary, a reasonable check is put upon the young people, it shall be likely to have a spirited contest of "Keeping up with the Joneses".

I believe to that large group of people who believe that such a Commencement is all wrong for a public school. It may be all right for a private institution or Lilliputian families. The public school is an institution primarily for people in moderate circumstances. The public school is an institution primarily for people in moderate circumstances. Nobody has the moral right to exclude the sons and daughters of any family from an account that will be dignified but plain and inexpensive Commencement. We stand for the dignified but plain and inexpensive Commencement. We stand for emphasis on intellectual attainment rather than on expensive superficial display.

In several towns boys and girls rent or make for themselves college cup and gown; in others, the girls place a limit on the expense of the material and then make their own gowns.

Trusting that Amityville may follow a reasonable course for June 1926, I remain

Very truly yours,

George A. Brown, Principal
