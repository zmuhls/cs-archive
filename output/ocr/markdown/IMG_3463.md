## Transcription

THE PASSING ONE-ROOM SCHOOL—The big new central schools being rushed into construction in the countryside around Albany are going to replace a lot of one-room schools like this one, the McKownville Branch School on Johnson Rd. A new Guilderland Central elementary school is scheduled to be started in construction next fall to take its pupils.

CRAMPED FOR SPACE—Inside the one-room McKownville Branch School there's not much room to move around. Mrs. Mary Mabie is shown with her class during a study period.
