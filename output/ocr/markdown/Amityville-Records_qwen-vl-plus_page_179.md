## Transcription

Mr. Case moved and Mrs. Hartman seconded the motion that contract be awarded to Howard Hogan at a net salary of $1,900.00, provided it is understood that only one member of the family be engaged. This motion unanimously carried.

Mr. Whitmore moved and Mr. Axtell seconded the motion that provided Mr. Hogan declines to accept the new contract that Mr. Ruff be empowered to offer a contract to Mrs. Hogan at a salary of $1,507.50 per year. This motion unanimously carried.

Mr. Ruff reported that he had under consideration the operation of the Kindergarten Department with but one teacher thereby relieving Miss Granant for duty in the first grade which would obviate the necessity of engaging a teacher in place of Miss Sharp, saving the District about $1,400.00.
