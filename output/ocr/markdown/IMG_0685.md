third. Latin composition is not a problem in itself, but is an index of the
freedom that has characterized the student's preparation in the
language. If he has been trained to read closely and accurately, after a
quick and accurate knowledge of forms, that student will write simple
Latin well. This really all that the colleges ask for. The writing of
connected narrative, more less figurative and involved, does not belong
to the secondary school.

The Development of the New York State Normal School

BY FRANCIS J. CHENEY, CORTLAND NORMAL SCHOOL.

To most of you it is, without doubt, a familiar story I have to tell,
and yet may not be without profit to repeat it.

The normal school as an institution has existed less than 300 years.
The first organization for the training of teachers, of which we have any
account, believed to have been established by La Salle at Reims, in about
the year 1683. A few years after the efforts of La Salle to furnish an
opportunity to those who wished to prepare themselves for teaching,
Augustus Hermann Ranke established a teachers' class at Halle, in
Prussia. He provided free board for such poor students as stood in need
of assistance, and selected out of the whole number twelve who exhibited
the right basis of piety, knowledge, skill and desire for teaching, and
constituted them his "Seminarium Preceptorium," or teachers' Seminary.
These pupil teachers received instruction for two years in methods, and,
in return, promised to teach for three years in the institution after
nishing their course. So successful was this work, that it is said, hundreds
of teachers were attracted from all parts of Europe to observe and study
the organization, methods and spirit of the school.

Other classes for teachers were opened in other parts of Germany.
Courses of lectures on the best methods of teaching German and the
ancient languages became common in the universities and higher schools
of Germany. From Germany the system spread to other parts of Europe;
but the normal school idea, we understand it, made little headway until
the beginning of the nineteenth century.

It is a mooted question how far these efforts in Europe to train
teachers influenced the normal school idea in the United States. Some
contend that they had no influence upon us whatever, as the earliest
advocates of the normal school in this country knew little or nothing of
what had been done in Europe. Although the seed was planted here as
early as 1816, it required time to take root. In that year a young man,
Denison Olmstead by name, a native of Connecticut, when writing his
oration for his master's degree took for his subject, [stamp: N.Y.S. Teachers' Association]
