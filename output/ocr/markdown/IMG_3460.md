**North Colony Plan**

Another three-part elementary school is now being planned in the area. After the North Colony Central District, the Board of Education and opposition leaders will have to find a site next year for a new kindergarten-sixth grade district in the Rosselle area. Another big $1,500,000, senior high school is being planned in Delmar, depending on how the vote on the project this spring will be. It is expected to be completed by September, 1954.

But leaders of an opposition group, the Citizens Association, have appealed to the commissioner of education to call a new vote. They have urged instead of the proposed new vote that the present high school be retained.

Other Needs

Besides these projects, in the Rensselaer County area, there are some growing outlying districts farther out, where a 10-room elementary school is needed. The Lake Central District, for example, has a 10-room elementary school at the end of the Hackett Blvd. extension in Delmar for 420 pupils. The district is planning to build a new elementary school for 210 pupils.

The high school problem has been heavy. While it is included in the Menands district, the only one confronting the Menands Problem while it is included in the Menands district has been heavy.

Groups Recommendations

The committee recommends construction of a new school on the site of the old elementary school building in the Menands district. The building is one of the most bitter fights the district has had.

**Here and There You'll Find One Bell Tolling for One-Room Schools**

By William E. Rowley

The "Country School of Tomorrow" is finished. This is how the new South Colony Central District will look when it is completed this summer. The sketch was made by Ryder & Link, Schenectady architects. The school will be at the end of Hackett Blvd. between the Albany and Sand Creek Rd.

Many Mergers Helped Districts Economize
