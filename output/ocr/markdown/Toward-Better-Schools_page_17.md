The 1952 Program

The Board of Education's staff recommended 18 schools for construction in the 1952 capital program. The Board of Education itself deleted four of these, then added 11 to bring the total proposed for the 1952 program up to 25. When it first considered the Board of Education's proposals, the City Planning Commission approved 16 of these schools. It added four, two of which were in staff proposals, and placed the 20 in the tentative capital budget. All were to be financed within the City's Constitutional debt limit.

Later the Planning Commission revised the budget and dropped seven of the schools. Subsequently, these seven schools were restored to the 1952 program and one more project added before the capital budget was adopted by the Board of Estimate and certified by the Mayor. Only 11 of these 21 projects finally approved were in the original staff proposals for 1952. This apparent uncertainty as to which schools should have priority in the capital program is a further indication of the need for carrying through the recommendations for changes in organization and procedures.

Construction of the eight schools added by the Planning Commission is contingent upon exclusion of the

$25.3 million capital expenditure for them from the City's Constitutional debt limit under terms of the Constitutional amendment approved by the people in November, 1951. A provision of this amendment, which became effective January 1, 1952, permits the City to exclude school construction debt to the extent that it can be financed by up to $2.5 million of the City's annual education aid. It is estimated this provision permits the exclusion from $30 to $40 million of school construction debt. Thus, the original proposal of the City Planning Commission to provide funds for 20 schools within the City's debt limit has been converted into a 21-school program which will use a substantial part of the school debt exclusion made available on January 1, 1952. Although part of this borrowing power outside the debt limit which now is being used will finance higher construction costs on some 1951 projects, the acquisition of more sites and a greater allocation for modernization, it is apparent the remainder is being used to permit non-educational capital programs to be expanded.

In view of the required expenditure of State aid revenue from the Board of Education's expense budget, there is a question whether use at this time of the additional school construction borrowing power is necessary or merely expedient.

Use of Private Architects

In line with the Commission's recommendation, private architects were employed to prepare plans for new school buildings and supplement the work of the Board of Education's Bureau of Design and Construction. Private architects designed 16 of the schools in the 1951 program, while the Bureau completed plans for 12. The City's School Construction Coordinator says that
