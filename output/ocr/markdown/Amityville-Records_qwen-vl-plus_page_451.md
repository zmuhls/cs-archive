## Transcription

After considerable discussion of the matter, the following motion was moved, duly seconded and carried:

"RESOLVED, that the Clerk write to the State Department at Albany and secure a ruling as to whether or not is is possible to grant the request."

The Clerk read communication received from Mr. Harry Paul Flahal and one from the Suffolk Guarantee and Title Company, requesting payment of $3.014.75 due for examination of premises known as Greenlawn Cemetary of Amityville.

Motion made, duly seconded and carried, that a check of One Thousand ($1000.) Dollars be sent to the Suffolk Guarantee and Title Company, on account of their bill of $3,014.75.

The following letter was received from the Village of Amityville and read by the Clerk:

"The subject of Village Nurse was brought up for discussion at a meeting of the Village Board hold on June 27th. It was decided that inasmuch as the Nurse has apparently done very little work in the Village outside of the schools, and we is now understood that she is away from the Village for a period of about two months, the Village Board will not be responsible for her salary at this time. The Village will, however, continue the maintenance of the care assigned to her use.

Yours very truly,
Louis W. Ferris,
Village Clerk."

Motion made, duly seconded and carried, that a Committee be appointed to wait on the Village Board and acquaint them with our view-point on the question of Nurse's salary.

The President thereupon appointed Mr. Thorn as the Committee.

At this time the Board went over the various items making up the budget but inasmuch as it was not in a position to decide on the waterproofing of the high school, it was decided to hold a special meeting on July 14th, for the adoption of the budget.

The Treasurer's report was read and approved.
