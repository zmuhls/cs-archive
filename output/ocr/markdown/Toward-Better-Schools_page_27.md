These standards require natural light as the primary source for classrooms and among the requirements is the following:
"The distance from the floor to the top of the window should be equal to or greater than half the width of the room, less one foot."

Although the purpose of this requirement is to increase natural light in the classroom, experience has shown that drawn shades and other methods of reducing glare and unpleasant sunlight actually defeat this purpose.

Its practical effect is to require that classrooms be constructed approximately 22 or 23 feet wide, with unnecesarily high ceilings. This produces relatively long, narrow classrooms, although other shapes would be more functional for many types of classroom activity. In instances where wide classrooms have been built, costly construction to obtain supplemental natural light has been necessary.

This provision also increases the amount of corridor space and consequently increases costs.

The Commission was convinced that a lighting standard based upon a satisfactory combination of artificial and natural lighting would make possible more functional and economical school buildings. However, because any change in the standard might have an effect on the health of the children, the Commission sought expert advice from specialists in this field and representatives of organizations and agencies concerned with the problem.

Lieutenant Governor Frank C. Moore, Chairman of the Commission, on October 8, 1931 designated a 19-member committee to review the State's present lighting standards and offer recommendations for changes, if they could be made without harmful effect on the children.

As a result of its thorough studies, this committee will submit a report to the Commission and the State Education Department.
