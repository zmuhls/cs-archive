Johns-Manville Inc.
Dato December 4, 1926.

If this proposition is acceptable to you
we would suggest that the re-surfacing of this
roof be held in abeyance until Spring when the
weather is more favorable for roofing work. In
this event we will make temporary repairs at this
time without expence to you.

Very truly yours,

JOHNS-MANVILLE, INC.
