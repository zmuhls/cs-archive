Amityville Public Schools  
AMITYVILLE, N.Y. May 25, 1926.  

Mrs. Ernest Hartman,  
President the Board of Education,  
Amityville, L. I.  

My dear Mrs. Hartman:  

Engaged in the report of the night school session.  
If there is any further information I can give, I shall be pleased to do so.  

I feel that it has been an oversight on the part of the board that I have not received a check for my work,  
and I would appreciate it greatly if you would attend to the matter for me.  

Very truly yours,  

[illegible]  

40 sessions 1 hour and fifteen  
minutes each = 50 hours.  

[illegible]  

There are four copies of Tools  
"Nautical English" to be returned  
to me left in the office for you next year.
