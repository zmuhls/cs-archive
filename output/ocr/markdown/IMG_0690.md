Proceedings of the

the Hon. Abram B. Weaver, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, issued a circular whose provisions were common to the five normal schools most recently established. In this circular he prescribed three courses of study: an elementary English course of two years, an advanced English course of four years. In each of these courses three years was practically given to professional work, and the remainder of the time devoted to subject matter.

The schools maintained, in general, two departments: A normal department and a practice school, the latter consisting of primary, intermediate and academic grades.

The normal schools that were established, subsequently, under general and special acts, were organized on the same plan. In 1886 a normal school was located at New Paltz, in 1889 another at Oneonta, in 1890 another at Plattsburgh, and in 1897 still another at Jamaica. In 1891 a so-called scientific course was added, consisting of the same subjects as the advanced English, with the addition of two years of Latin and two years of either French, German or Greek.

In 1892, on the recommendation of the normal school principals, the elementary English course was abolished. The remaining three were continued until 1900, when the scientific course was dropped. The English course lengthened to four years, the classical course somewhat modified, and two two-year courses, English and classical, for high school graduates, were added.

Along with the unification of our educational departments has come another change resulting in a general reorganization of the normal schools in this State. They now consist of a training school, a model high school and a normal or professional school proper. The training school is made up of all the grades below the high school, in many instances including the kindergarten department.

In the high school there are three courses of study, each four years in length.

The first course is intended for those who wish to enter the normal or professional school, and is open to any resident of the State who wishes to prepare for teaching, and who does not reside in a district where a high school is already established.

The second prepares for admission to college, and the third for admission to schools of technology. These last two are open to students only who live within the limits of the corporation where the normal school which they attend is located.

Students, however, who wish to take the normal school preparatory course for admission to the normal can do so; instead of the first course mentioned.

Candidates for admission to the normal school must be at least sixteen years of age, and must present a high school diploma, or its equivalent, as approved by the Commissioner of Education. Beginning with September, 1907, candidates must present a diploma showing that they have graduated from the course of study prescribed by the Commissioner of Education for admission to normal schools and city training schools under the provisions of Chapter 1031, Laws of 1895.

Persons who are twenty-one years of age, and have had two years of high school work, or its equivalent, and have also taught two years, will be admitted to the normal school, but must complete the high school course in addition to the professional course before they can be graduated.

Persons who hold training class certificates, having entered the training from the training class, and who have taught one year since graduating, and who have shown, by their work, that they show the required aptitude for training.

The professional or normal school course, proper, is a two year course, consisting of observation and practice work. There is also a kindergarten course of the same length for such of the schools as conduct a kindergarten department.

These courses have not been in operation long enough to prove their value as compared with that of the courses which they have displaced. One thing indicated will need no other experience to give him an adequate idea of the strenuous life.

Such is the history of the development of the New York Normal School. It has had to fight its way. It has great opposition. Had it not had able and influential friends the chances of its survival would have been remote. When there was but one normal school no opposition was manifest, but when seven additional schools were established
