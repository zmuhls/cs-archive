DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.

so easy to present work at an institute. He found it difficult to select institute instructors. He considered it well to make a close connection between the institute and the Normal school. He considered that Normal school classes were not injured by being left for a day. The Superintendent suggested the establishment of an institute, to last three or four weeks, at which the attendance should be voluntary.

The question was asked whether the summer schools are not calculated to meet the wants of untrained teachers. Superintendent Draper thought not, as they are often inconveniently situated, and were of a higher grade than the schools which young teachers had.

A question was asked, whether institute conductors or commissioners are always calculated to know the needs of a district? A suggestion was made in regard to institute work being more progressive, so that the conductor might begin the second year where he had finished the first, and thus avoid repetition.

The following remarks were made by Superintendent Edward Waite of Lansingburgh, Thursday afternoon, July seven, at the court-house:

THE TRUE WORK OF THE TEACHER.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.—Though we may not number so many Ph. D.'s, not so many A. M.'s, nor consume so many letters of the alphabet to announce our position and mark our standing as do those who form the other bodies of this association, yet we can flatter ourselves that we are the real teachers of this great State; the ones in whose charge the future destiny of this great State is placed, and no college dons nor university professors can wrest it from us. We instruct, and wield, and mold the fragments that, having passed through our hands, by force of circumstances alone, fall to their lot.

We may not construct so many M. D.'s nor D. D.'s as they, but we do finish up and turn out upon the world the artisan, the agriculturist, in short, the whole producing class that build up, clear away and push on the thriving industries of this vast country in this driving age. Most of the great men of the day are the product of the common schools, without the aid of college or professor's chair. They learned their habit of steady thought and patient industry in the humble school-house by the roadside, and following in the lines so carefully fixed by some intelligent yet unknown-to-fame teacher, they have made our land famed among the famous.

The teachers of the elementary schools, instruct the millions. The question at once arises, do we appreciate our business? When the welfare and the prosperity of the land and its people are in our hands as they surely are, and we train and form to a large extent the bent and inclining mass, are we doing our best that our work shall achieve the most good?

There are many difficult and new problems to solve. New and sturdy books for teachers to solve four.
