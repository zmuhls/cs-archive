Kenneth McKenzi Clerk

[correction: "Bunian McDonold" appears to be a misspelling of "Benjamin McDonold" or similar; the name is uncertain due to handwriting.]

Note: The document shows signs of age with some faded ink and possible water damage, particularly around the edges. The handwriting is consistent throughout, suggesting a single author. The abbreviation "No." is used for "Number," and "adjourned" is written in a cursive style typical of the period. The date format follows the 19th-century practice of placing the day before the month.
