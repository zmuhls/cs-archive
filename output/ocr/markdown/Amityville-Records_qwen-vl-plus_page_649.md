Mr. Vogel reported that two days after awarding the contract for floors to the low bidder, Mr. Haff, he had received a telephone call from Mr. Haff asking that he be released from his bid as he could not afford to do the work for the amount specified. The matter was left in the hands of the Building and Grounds Committee for further handling.

The Board thereupon went into executive session for the preparation of a budget for the coming school year. On re-convening from executive session the following budget was adopted as the budget of expenses for the school year 1930-31 and the Clerk was directed to cause the same to be published in both newspapers published in Amityville.
