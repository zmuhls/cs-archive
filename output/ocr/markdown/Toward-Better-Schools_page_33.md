V. Recommendations

The Commission, as a result of its intensive studies during the past year, makes the following recommendations for State legislation and local action:

STATE LEGISLATION

It is recommended that the 1952 Legislature adopt measures which will:

1. Improve and extend for another year the program of State advances to financially hard-pressed school districts with emergency school building requirements (Section 3603-c of the Education Law) and increase the appropriation from $300,000 to $700,000.

2. Encourage school districts in cities under 125,000 population to consolidate with suburban districts to form enlarged city school districts through a special State aid formula, thus making it possible to provide better schools, better use of schools, a broader base for taxing and borrowing, and a more equitable distribution of the tax burden.

3. Encourage the formation of larger school districts in cities, suburbs, and rural areas so that high schools will be available for peak enrollments of the future and local expense of providing high schools will be more equitably distributed over the territory the schools serve by revising the State aid provisions for non-resident pupils, contract districts, and districts which do not operate high schools.

4. Speed up the payment of normal State assistance to the rapidly growing school districts; thereby increasing local ability to finance school buildings.

5. Clarify certain provisions of the Education Law which relate to designation of sites for school buildings and the jurisdiction of the State Education Commissioner over health and safety regulations.

6. Extend the life of the Commission another year.

Detailed information on each recommendation follows:

1. Emergency State Advances

During the past year, six districts qualified for emergency advances from the $300,000 appropriation made by the Legislature for the 1951-52 Fiscal year. However, the Commission estimates that a greater number of districts will qualify during the next year and that an appropriation of $700,000 will be needed to finance this program in 1952-53, providing the provision for rapidly growing districts is adopted.

The bill submitted by the Commission for extension of the emergency advance program contains several amendments to the existing law (Section 3603-c, Education Law) which experience has indicated are needed. These amendments will:

A. Give preference during this period of increasing elementary school enrollments to applications for construction of elementary schools to eliminate or avoid overcrowding.

B. Give preference at this time to applications for high school construction to the districts which cannot send their high school pupils to other districts and which have taken action to include in the districts all the territory that should be served by the new high school.

C. Change and clarify cost allowance provisions, define more precisely the debt service for which advances of State money will be made and otherwise clarify the computation of the emergency advances.

D. Clarify provisions relating to repayment of advances and provide for a longer repayment period under certain conditions.

E. Eliminate the section relating to districts which had emergency school building requirements prior to April 1, 1951, because they have had two years to apply for advances and include a section for districts which have had emergency requirements since that date.

F. Repeal the provision granting aid for planning of school construction because there have been no applications for this type of assistance.

2. Enlarged City School Districts

City school districts in cities under 125,000 population generally provide for the education of pupils from a large number of districts in the areas surrounding the city.

In the past, much of the cost of educating these non-resident pupils has been borne by the city district and the State through education aid, while the local tax rates of the outlying districts have remained far below that of the city district.

The Commission has found that the present State law on education aid for contract districts and non-resident pupils is one of the factors which has caused an inequitable local tax burden as between the districts which operate schools and those that do not and has erected a barrier to enlargement of the city school districts. The fact that some districts do not charge tuition sufficient to cover the cost of instructing non-resident pupils is another factor.

To facilitate the enlargement of city school districts, the Commission is recommending the Legislature approve a revised State aid formula applicable to annexation of rural districts to a city school district.
