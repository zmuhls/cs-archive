NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION

RANDOLPH, MASS., APRIL 19, 1897.

THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION:
It would give me great pleasure to con- 
trive an opportunity even to New 
Yorkers to cover ground that is surely ex- 
cept from car windows once a year and then 
imperfectly. The Coaches will leave the College 
at 8 o'clock on 
TUESDAY, JULY 1, 
making the trip, as outlined on another page, 
returning to the Grand Union Hotel at 6 o'clock. 
Tickets are $2.00, and they must be 
secured in advance of Local Secretary. 

Mary E. WILKINS.
