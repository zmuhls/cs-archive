1950, which permits city school districts in cities under 10,000 population to become part of a central school district and thus qualify for additional State aid.

The Commission believes that a uniform law should apply to enlargement of city school districts in all cities under 125,000 population, but it is not sound State policy or finance to treat these cities as central school districts.

State aid provisions for central school districts were designed to help the districts with the higher costs which result from sparsity of population. The sparsity of population factor in enlarged city school districts generally exists only in the area outside the city.

Therefore, the Commission recommends that the present law affecting school districts in and around cities of less than 10,000 population be discontinued after June 30, 1954.

At present, these districts are eligible for centralization if the local real estate valuation is less than $15,000 per resident pupil. This figure is considerably higher than the average valuation per resident pupil in central school districts and should be changed to $9,000. Two low valuation city school districts which have taken steps to form central districts would still be eligible if the figure is reduced to $9,000.

3. Contract Districts and Non-Residents

The Commission believes that the State education aid formula should be modified at some future date (possibly July 1, 1957) so that its provisions help bring about greater equity in local tax rates as between districts which operate schools and those which do not.

Therefore, it recommends (1) that the provisions of the State education aid formula be modified at some future date (possibly July 1, 1957) so that the apportionment of State aid will be based upon resident pupils only and (2) that State aid provisions for contract districts and districts not operating high schools be gradually modified to help bring about greater equity in local tax rates.

The first proposal would have a threefold effect:

A. Districts would be inclined to charge more tuition for instructing pupils from another district.

B. School districts contracting for the education of all their children and districts which do not operate high schools would have to assume their fair share of the cost of educating their children.

C. The tax advantage now enjoyed by the districts which send all or some of their children to school in other districts would be reduced and creation of larger school districts in these areas would be encouraged.

The change would not mean a sudden or drastic readjustment in State education aid beginning with the future date selected because a three-year average of attendance is used in computing State aid. The full effect, therefore, would not be felt until the third following the effective date.

If the year 1957 were used, the districts affected would have about nine years in which to become part of a central, consolidated or enlarged city school district capable of providing a broader tax base to support a complete educational program and to finance school buildings.

The second proposal would involve gradually raising the minimum tax rate required for apportionment of full State aid to contract districts and districts not operating high schools to a point where the rate would be approximately the same as the average of the rates in the districts which do operate high schools.

Contract districts are now required to have one of three minimum tax rates, $4, $5, or $6.20 per $1,000 valuation, depending upon the particular formula under which they receive State aid. Almost all districts operating high schools must have a $6.20 minimum local tax rate before they can receive full State aid.

As the first step in carrying out the second recommendation the Commission is submitting a bill providing a minimum local tax rate requirement of $6.20 per $1,000 full valuation for all contract districts.

The further steps to be taken will depend upon the result of the state-wide study of State equalization rates and the effect of the new rates upon the education aid formula and the local full valuation tax rates.

The Commission's studies indicate that timely construction of high schools needed after 1956 will place greater burdens upon local resources and make it imperative that the real estate tax base supporting the high school include all of the assessed valuation in the territory it serves.

The Commission recommends, therefore, that after a reasonable period of time (for example, 1960) a school district that does not instruct all of its own high school pupils should become part of a district large enough to operate a high school.

4 Rapidly Growing Districts

The use of a three year average of daily attendance in the formula for apportionment of State education aid has created a lag in payment of aid to rapidly growing school districts, thereby increased local tax rates and made difficult for these districts to finance the volume of school construction required.

Last year, the Commission recommended that relief be afforded districts having an attendance increase of more than 10 per cent in one year. The Legislature authorized a special appropriation to assist the rapidly growing districts, but the application of the statute was limited thereafter to those districts which had an attendance increase of 50 per cent in one year or 90 per cent in two years.

Experience has shown that a very small number of school districts can benefit from the present law and that other suburban districts with much smaller enrollment
