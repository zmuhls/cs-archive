**Notes:**

* The "No. of Unit" column has entries for 1 and 2.
* The "NAME OF TOWN" column has "Dannemora" for unit 1 and is blank for unit 2.
* The "DATE OF SCHOOL MEETING ORGANIZING DISTRICT" column lists "U.F.S. 1 and 243" for unit 1 and "U.F.S. 4 and 5" for unit 2.
* The "DATE ON WHICH PAPERS WERE APPROVED AT DEPARTMENT" column is blank for both units.
* The "REMARKS" column is blank for both units.
* There is a handwritten signature under unit 2, but it is not legible enough to transcribe accurately.
