The President stated that the meeting was called to consider the matter of additional school facilities as the State Department of Education would not approve the plans as prepared for an addition to the present Grammar School. The President also reported that on his instructions the advertisements covering the proposition to be voted on December 16th had been corrected to call for an additional Grammar School Building.  

Mr. Lewis Ingles laid before the Board plans for a twelve room building to be located between the present Grammar School Building and the Beeser property and facing on Park Avenue in line with the High School Building.  

After a general discussion of the proposition it was regularly moved, duly seconded and carried, that the Board approve the plans as shown by the Architect provided said plans are approved by the State Department of Education.  

Moved, duly seconded and carried, that the job of printing the pamphlet of school facts be given to the Amity Printing House.  

There being no further business the meeting thereupon adjourned.
