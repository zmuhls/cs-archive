The Board thereupon went into executive session for the preparation of a budget for the ensuing school year. On re-convening from executive session the following budget was recommended, and on motion duly made, seconded and carried, was adopted as the budget of expenses for the school year 1826-1827, and the Clerk was directed to cause the same to be published in both newspapers published in Amityville.

The President called for the bids for the repairing of the defective plaster of the high school building. Bids were received as follows:

J. N. Briggs, Massapeoque, $ 3,262.00
Charles A. Walters, Amityville, 1,200.00

Motion made, duly seconded [illegible] that action on the bids be deferred at this meeting.

The question of the adoption of the foregoing resolution was only put to a vote which resulted as follows:

Ayes: 2 (Carswell & Burns)
Noes: 2 (Vogel & Ingle)
Absent: 3
Total: 7

The President thereupon declared the adoption of the resolution lost.

The President suggested that due to the wide discrepancy in the bids that they be rejected and that the Building Committee be authorized to advertise and receive bids under prepared specifications.

At this time Mr. Vogel requested that the Board accept his resignation from the Building Committee. No action was taken on this request.
