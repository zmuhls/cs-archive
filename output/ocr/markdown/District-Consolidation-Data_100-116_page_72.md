**Notes:**
- The table structure is preserved with vertical bars (`|`) separating columns.
- Pre-printed text (e.g., "Town School Units," "NAME OF TOWN") is included as headers.
- Filled-in text (e.g., "Newport," "U.F.S. 1 and 2, 4, 5, 6") is transcribed as is.
- Blank fields are indicated with `[blank]`.
- Alignment is maintained where meaningful (e.g., date columns are aligned under "Day," "Month," "Year").
