## Transcription

The Clerk read letter from the Mason-Hamlin Company, quoting
a price of $775, on an Oak Midget Upright Piano and a price of $395,
on the same type finished in Mahogany, both subject to a trade
discount of ten and ten percent.

Motion made, seconded and carried, that the matter of
purchasing a piano be referred to Mr. Brockington and if he is
able to secure as low a price on the type of piano as quoted by
Mason-Hamlin, that the order for it be given to him.

Motion made, seconded and carried, that Mr. Ruff be authorized
to attend the Principals' Convention at Syracuse, at the District's
expense.

Motion made, seconded and carried, that Mr. Ruff be empowered
to order such supplies as are necessary to conduct the intelligence
tests.

There being no further business, the meeting thereupon adjourned.

C. Wharvey
