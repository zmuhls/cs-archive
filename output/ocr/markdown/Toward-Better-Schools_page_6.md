**I. Meeting the Problem**

The New York State Commission on School Buildings was created by the 1950 Legislature to help the localities meet their emergency and long-range needs for public school buildings. The Commission was established upon the recommendation of the Moore Committee on Constitutional Tax and Debt Limitations after that Committee, at the request of the Governor and the State Education Commissioner, had considered various reports of school building needs and proposals to finance those needs. The Moore Committee determined that a huge State issue for school construction was not necessary and that, with the aid of informed guidance and modernization of local taxing and borrowing powers, most of the State's school districts could meet school construction needs for a number of years with their own resources. In compliance with the Legislature's direction, this Commission has attacked school construction problems from every angle.

Primary causes of the school building problems with which the localities have been faced are the heavy postwar migration to the suburbs, shifts of population within cities, development of new industrial centers and expansion and relocation of industries, enlargement of school districts, postponement of school construction during the Depression and war years, the inadequate size of many buildings constructed during the 1930s (mostly in central school districts) when births were at a very low level, and changes in educational programs.

The Commission first concentrated attention on the needs of districts with special or acute problems (New York City, the rapidly growing suburbs, and districts with heavy debt or tax burdens). The Commission initiated studies to determine the immediate and long-range school building requirements of all school districts in the State and undertook to develop a program whereby the localities could meet these needs from local resources to the fullest extent possible.

**Causes of the Problem**

Public concern about the need for new school buildings and the financial ability of localities to construct them had been aroused by the large number of births in postwar years. The average was more than 300,000 a year between 1946 and 1951. However, the Commission's study has disclosed that most of the school building problems to date have not been caused by increased births alone. Elementary school enrollments for the 1951-52 school year generally are no higher than in 1936-37. There still are more than 100,000 fewer children in elementary schools than during the peak year of 1931-32. The postwar births will not raise elementary school enrollments to a record high until sometime during the next six years. High school enrollments generally are at the lowest level reported in 20 years.

**The Commission's Reports**

In its first report to the Legislature (January 10, 1951), the Commission discussed the school construction problems of the City of New York and the reasons why that City's construction program had bogged down. It also offered recommendations for local action to break bottlenecks and speed construction in that City where nearly half the public school children of the State are educated. How New York responded and what remains to be done is discussed later in this report.

In its second report (February 14, 1951), the Commission discussed state-wide problems of school construction, disclosed that some 50 school districts appeared to be facing financial hardship in meeting construction needs, advocated continuation of the emergency aid program inaugurated in 1950 at the suggestion of the Moore Committee.
