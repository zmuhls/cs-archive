DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION

was of those who, before the dawning of a better day, watch the flushing
east and the paling star.

Announcements were here made at this point by the president,
concerning the session of the New York State Art Teachers' Association in the
afternoon, and by transportation Agent Cooper concerning rates and routes
to the national educational meeting at Asbury Park.

PRESIDENT HARDY:—Not long ago one of our commissioners of
education of the City of New York brought to the attention of the educational
community a great and crying evil. The matter was taken up by the New
York principals, heralded by the press throughout the country and
movements inaugurated in all of the large cities of the union, going so far
west as San Francisco. The gentleman who so generously gave his time
and attention to this matter we have with us this morning and I take great

MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:—I confess to a feeling of
earnest sympathy with the sentiment that fell from the scholarly lips of
Columbia's gifted president last night, when he said that in this presence
he could not escape a feeling of awe as he reflected how largely you controlled
the destinies of thousands of our future citizens, and through them the
school commissioner has not tended to lessen that feeling as it goes out to
you and the members of your guild.

You are indeed the standing army of the republic, although you use
in your warfare books and not bayonets, brains and not bullets, making
apprehension upon vice and ignorance wherever found. As we gaze with
apprehension upon that blood red cloud that is all too far up in the western
envelopes our Empire state, who will deny that troubled atmosphere that
York public school teacher and the New York public school system has
not contributed much to the well-rounded citizenship and manliness of our
workmen, that in times like these painful ones we are now enduring, causes
