Special Meeting of the Board of Education held on  
Thursday, September 15, 1927, at 8:25 P.M.  

Meeting called in order by the President, who stated  
the meeting would be confined to act upon the two  
propositions (Rate of Tuition and Report of Trans-  
portation) mentioned in the Secretary's notice of  
this meeting.  

The President stated that the Secretary was detained  
by business in the City and would be unable to attend.  
He thereupon suggested that Mr. R. A. Gardiner, Treas-  
urer act as Temporary Secretary.  

Moved, seconded and carried, that all business  
transacted at this meeting be considered the same as  
that transacted at any regular meeting.  

Letter dated September 16, 1927, of Rose & Paskins,  
Attorneys, 188 Broadway, New York, to the Board of  
Education, read as follows:  

"As I considered the form of contract submitted for  
opinion inapplicable to the work because it presupposes  
the employment of an architect, which I understand is  
not being done by the Board, and for the further reason  
that it failed to embody certain provisions which I  
consider advisable for the proper protection of the  
District, I have prepared a new form of contract in  
the form deemed sufficient by me for your proper  
protection, which I herewith submit.  

Yours very truly,  

L. S. Colt"  

Moved, seconded and carried, that the letter together  
with form of contract submitted for opinion be placed  
on file, and the new form of contract in triplicate be  
accepted and executed, also that the bill of Fifty  
($50.) Dollars, for legal services, be paid.  

Transportation Committee reports that it will award  
the bus contract for the remainder of the ensuing year  
to Rebecca Leigh.  

Moved, seconded and carried, that the tuition per  
student for non-residents be Fifty ($50.) Dollars per  
year, except where state pays Nothing.
