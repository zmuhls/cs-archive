The New York State Teachers' Association

2. Because of the stimulating influence upon one of an interested membership in an organization of his co-workers.
3. Because of the effective service which, since its organization, it has rendered to the New York State teacher, in privileges, security, salary, and fresh insights into education.
4. Because of the present need for concerted action to further improve teaching conditions, and to stimulate public co-operation.
5. Because of the small expense and the large professional advantages of such membership, in the way of published proceedings, monographs and bulletins, the New York State Education subscription and a central office of information.

These five items are an inventory only of the more obvious advantages of cooperative effort through the New York State Teachers Association, that should enroll a 100% membership of the New York State teachers. Nowhere else has a central organization reason to expect more loyal support in money and time, and contributions of material, Thirty-four thousand New York State teachers know that it pays.

"In other fields a very much shorter period of training results in much larger rewards. It is not because we would argue in favor of increasing our own salaries that we hope to place in every school room a better teacher. It is only because we believe that the nation cannot afford to have any better trained men and women in the school rooms that we would argue for more money for the support of our teachers."—George D. Strayer, Claxton, U. S. Commissioner.

"The people themselves and their representatives in tax-levying bodies need so large dividends in material wealth as do investors in popular education; and that comparative poverty is not to be shown that no other use of investment field so large as the means of education is not as a reason for withholding the means of education, but rather as a reason for supplying them in larger proportion."—Hon. P. P.
