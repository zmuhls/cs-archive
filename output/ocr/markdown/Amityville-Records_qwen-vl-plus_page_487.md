THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
ALBANY

December 16, 1927

Mr. Arthur W. Ruff
Supervising Principal
Amityville, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Ruff:

Your letter of December 12th is received.

I do not understand that school property can be given over to a private individual or corporation for his or its own private uses. For instance, I find no authority under which a board of education may grant to an individual the use of a room or rooms in a school building during or after school hours for the purpose of enrolling such students as he may please and charging a tuition fee for their instruction. If this could be done then the school building could be rented for any private, commercial purpose.

In some cases, however, I find a number of students who have joined together and have asked permission of the board of education to use a room in the school building certain hours after school for the purpose of receiving instruction in music or in some other subject.
