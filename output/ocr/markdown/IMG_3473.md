The Administrator's Status and Compensation

This is the setting in which a board of education is called upon not only to find the right person to be its administrator but also to determine what salary the superintendent shall receive during his term of employment. In the world of commerce and industry, an executive may be compensated by his board of directors in any or all of the following ways:

- He is given a designated salary.
- To his salary may be added, depending upon the degree of success which has been achieved by his conduct of the business during a given year, a bonus of some flat amount, usually not predetermined, or determined, or premined plan which he understands in advance.
- A share in the profits according to some predetermined plan which he understands in advance.
- He may receive dividends on company stock which he is permitted and encouraged to buy at favorable prices, thus becoming in fact a part owner in the business he is employed to operate.
