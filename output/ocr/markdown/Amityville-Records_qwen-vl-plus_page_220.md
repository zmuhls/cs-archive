the burglary insurance would cover any property of the
school district while contained in any property but
that any loss must be shown to have taken place as a
result of forcible entry. After some discussion, Mr. Ketcham
moved and Mr. Whitmore seconded the motion that a burglary
insurance policy be taken out in the amount of $2,000.00.
This motion unanimously carried.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported progress
in the matter of the proposal of the Obelisk Waterproofing
Company to repair building for leaks.

Mr. Case for the Building and Grounds Committee reported
that they could not see the necessity of installing automatic
fire equipment in line with Mr. Carwalt's recommendations
and that if automatic equipment is necessary it should be
through a sprinkler system. Mr. Case recommended
extinguishers be purchased for use in the domestic science
room and pointed out that the area occupied in the welfare
committee was a fire hazard.
