The New York State Teachers' Association

of all the teachers in these revenue and salary campaigns ahead of us and in our other campaigns for the welfare of teachers and children and the good of the schools in general. NO teacher can afford NOT to be a MEMBER of the State Association.

The Association will use its influence to promote the passage of a law giving administrative independence to school boards so that boards may determine the amount and collect the resources necessary for a successful administration of school systems and may enable them to pay teachers a just compensation without restriction by municipal authorities.

It will work for the passage of a law which will protect the present State quotas for teachers and, if possible, to secure increased and equitable distribution of State assistance in the financial support of schools.

The Association proposes to find out what the local and rural authorities wish and to assist in securing such legislation as the rural school authorities feel is needed.

To secure the passage of a law which will place all health education, including medical inspection and school nursing, entirely under the jurisdiction of educational authorities rather than under the control of boards of health.

To do everything possible to secure better living conditions for teachers both in the city and rural communities.

To co-operate in every way possible with the State Department of Education in the securing of a higher standard of professional training for teachers and thereby increase the efficiency of our schools.

To secure the enactment of laws which will bring about increased compensation and higher professional consideration for teachers.
