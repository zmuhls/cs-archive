The Teachers Committee reported no unexcusable absences
for the month of April but that Mrs. Katherine Hilthroth
had substituted for one day; Mrs. Teresa Bunce, three days;
Mrs. Angeline Kinne, one day; Mrs. Catherine Powell, six days;
Mrs. Katharine Fisher, one day; Mrs. Edith Gardiner, one day;
Joseph Cheeckovich, nine days; and Mrs. Jennie Francis, one day
and Mrs. Emma Dayton, nine days and that the substitute
teachers were entitled to the regular compensation for such
services. Mrs. Hartman moved and Mr. Axtell seconded the
motion that the report be accepted and placed on file
and that the substitute teachers be paid accordingly.
This motion unanimously carried.

The Teachers' Committee reported that both Mrs.
Chloester and Miss Frantz had asked if their salary
for the coming year could be re-considered. Mr.
Ruff explained the reason prompting each teacher
to request additional remuneration but had no
recommendation to make in either case but had
no changes be made in the contracts offered.

Mrs. Hartman submitted letter of Mary Dowling
requesting release from her contract as teacher,
effective as of May 11, 1934, on account of health
and on advise of physician. Mrs. Hartman moved
and Mr. Whitmore seconded that Mrs. Dowling
be released from her contract effective May 11,
1934, as requested. This motion unanimously
carried.

Mrs. Hartman also submitted safetere report for
the month of April. It was ordered received and
placed on file.

Mr. Ruff submitted a chart showing the difference
in cost of heating the high school and grammar
school buildings for the past six years and suggested
that the Board consider changing over the heating
system of the grammar school building
with the boilers in the new building. After some
discussion on the proposition, Mr. Heab seconded
the motion that the matter be referred to the
Building and Grounds Committee to get an
approximate cost of doing the work and the
savings which would result from such a move.
This motion unanimously carried.

Mr. Ruff also inquired as to what disposition the
Board wanted to make of the money to be received
from the Blue Bird Studio of Philadelphia.
Mr. Axtell moved and Mr. Heab seconded the
motion that the matter of allocating the money
be left to the discretion of Mr. Ruff. This motion
unanimously carried.
