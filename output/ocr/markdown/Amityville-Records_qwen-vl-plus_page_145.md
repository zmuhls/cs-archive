Special Meeting of the Board of Education held at the High School

The President stated that the object of the meeting was to receive bids

The President read the demand of the First National Bank and Trust
Company of Amityville for the sum of $301.80 with interest thereon
from the 31st day of December, 1928, for the refund of 1928 Bank
Tax, which tax it was alleged, was levied and collected in violation
of Sec. 5219 of the United States Revised Statutes and Sec. 24 of
the Tax Law of the State of New York. The President also read letter
of William H. E. Jay, Jr., Counselor at Law, 11 W. 40th St., New York
City, written on behalf of his client, the First National Bank and
Trust Company of Amityville. On motion the communications were ordered
referred and the Clerk instructed to refer the same to Samuel P. Hildreth,
Counselor at Law, for consideration.

Pursuant to advertisements published in the local newspapers bids
were received from the following for the laying of sidewalks around
the new grammar school building:

The John H. French Company      $1,789.00
Charles A. Walters             1,534.75

It was moved, duly seconded and carried, that action on the awarding
of contract for sidewalks for the new grammar school building be
postponed.

The Clerk read proposal of Clifford Baxter of Amityville for the
furnishing of all labor necessary to install the automatic gas
heaters, exclusive, however, of connecting the hot water tank to
