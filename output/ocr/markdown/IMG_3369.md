The following questions are suggested, though it is not intended to limit discussion to them:

Should the instruction begin with Form Study, for the purpose of developing concepts of form, for the purpose of developing the forms selected and the nature of the child's expression? If so, what should be the character of the forms selected and the nature of the child's expression?

Should expression be largely or wholly free and spontaneous for the purpose of developing free activity of the child's mind and powers of expression, or should the class be directed by the teacher in such a way as to secure as perfect results as possible?

Should any mechanical means or methods be allowed in drawing in the primary grades?

Should the instruction in the lowest grades begin with Imaginative Drawing? And if so, what should be the nature of the work, and how should it be conducted?

Should Pictorial Drawing from objects or nature be continued throughout the lowest grades and be continued throughout the lowest grades? If so, what should be the nature of the objects used, and the character and aim of the instruction? Should there be any attempt to teach perspective principles?
