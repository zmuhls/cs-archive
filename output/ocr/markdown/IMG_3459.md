**Schools--Major Problem in Area Suburbs**  
*Cost of New Building Nears $20 Million As 'Kid Crop' Jams Present Structures*  
By William E. Rowley  

The touchiest subject in the suburban and rural country around Albany is schools. Mention the word to a suburbanite or countryman and you'll draw a warm response. Their sensitivity, which is difficult for a city dweller to understand, is due to two big problems: the need to get many new large schools built fast, and the heavy increase in school enrollments is bulging the walls of the one-room schoolhouse.  

The school district that is faring somewhat similarly around Albany is just the growing pains of a development that's taking place around most U.S. cities. The planners, trying hard but not always in failure to get schools built, built, built, are being pressed by the taxpayers who are likely to pay for the schools. The scattered "nights" are sometimes healthy signs of democratic opposition and serve as a brake on the builders' speed and school. But the offer they have slowed down the big building job that is already late. Next year there will be more children in crowded improvised classrooms like the one-room schoolhouse.  

Trying to get a better look at the rate of the builders' speed at this rate of the race of the builders is bulging the walls of the one-room schoolhouse. The Knickerbocker News reports that the new big central schools being built in the countryside around Albany are going to replace a lot of one-room schools like the one, the McKowville Branch School on Farnham Road.  

**THE PASSING ONE-ROOM SCHOOL**  
The new big central schools being built in the countryside around Albany are going to replace a lot of one-room schools like the one, the McKowville Branch School on Farnham Road.  

**$2 Million Fight Goes to 'Referee'**  
The fight over a $1,500,000 senior high school project in Delmar will be brought before the voters of the district on April 14. A. Willis, chairman of the district's Board of Education, will conduct a hearing at 2 p.m. inst. to get the approval of opposition leaders in the district who have appealed a Board decision to go ahead with the project.  

**High School Project**  
The high school project in Columbia County Central School District is the next step in the suburban development of the district. It is aimed to relieve the overcrowding and opposition leaders have declared defeated last spring. The board found that only a simple majority vote is needed to pass the $20 million mark by 1960.  

**CRAMPED FOR SPACE**
