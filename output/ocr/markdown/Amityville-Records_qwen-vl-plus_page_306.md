Special Meeting of the Board of Education held at the High School
on Monday, July 22, 1935, at 8 o'clock p. m., pursuant to notice
for the purpose of receiving bids for the installation of an oil
burner system.

The meeting was called to order by Clinton Ingle, President.

Present:
Mr. Clinton Ingle, President.
Mr. Christian Haab,
"Theodore F. Artell, Jr.,
Hilford H. Ketcham,
Mrs. Florence Hartman, Trustee.
Mr. C. R. Warren, Clerk.

Absent:
Mr. Willet F. Whitmore, Trustee.
Mr. R. A. Gardiner, Treasurer.

The following bids were deposited with the Clerk and read accordingly:

Fred M. R. Holmstedt (Johnson) $ 9,506.00
Charles A. Artzmann, Jr. (Simpler) 10,065.00
Preferred Equipment Co., Inc. (Bay) 10,466.00
Fred S. Robbins, Inc. (Petro) 11,300.00
Enterprise Engineering Co., Inc. (Enterprise) 0,953.00
Breuer Engineering Co., Inc. (Todd) 9,630.00

The Clerk announced that the bids of the Enterprise Engineering
Company, Inc., and the Breuer Engineering Co., Inc., were not
accompanied by certified checks as called for in the advertisement
for bids.

Mr. Artell moved and Mr. Haab seconded the motion that the bids
be referred to the Building and Grounds Committee for consideration
in conjunction with the Architect and Engineer and that the
ordering of the contract be deferred until a report with recommendations
is made by the Committee. This motion unanimously carried.

The President announced that the meeting would recess for about
one hour to permit the Building and Grounds Committee to go over
the proposals.

At 9:21 P. M., the President again called the meeting to order and
received a report from the Engineer favoring the acceptance of the
Enterprise bid. The Engineer reported that the burner was a very
successful one and that the bid being the lowest it was to the best
interest of the District to accept it. Mr. J. S. Kaplan of the
Preferred Equipment Company protested the recommendation for the
reason that the bid was not a formal one as a certified check did
not accompany the proposal as called for in the notice to bidders
and therefore should not receive consideration by the Board.
Mr. Malinsteed likewise protested the recommendation of the Engineer.

After some discussion the President announced that the meeting
would adjourn until Wednesday, July 24, 1935, at 8 o'clock p. m.,
to give the Building and Grounds Committee more time with the bids.
