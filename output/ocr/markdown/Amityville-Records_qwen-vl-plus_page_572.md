The minutes of the previous regularly meeting were read and the Clerk was instructed to record therein the fact that Mr. Ruff had asked the members of the Board of any complaints had been received in regard to the operation of the burses.

The Clerk read communication of April 3, 1929, from George W. I. Dwinell, Attorney at Law, 66 Court Street, Brooklyn, N. Y., who on behalf of Mr. Charles Peone, demanded that the Board pay Mr. Peone the sum of One Hundred ($100.) Dollars due him for services rendered as engineer. On motion made, duly seconded and carried, it was resolved that Mr. Peone be paid the sum of One Hundred ($100.) Dollars, balance due him.

The Clerk read letter of Mr. Harry Paul Finchel in regard to the "Condemnation of Amitville Cemetery" and apprised the Board of the fact that three commissioners had been appointed to take testimony, etc. Mr. Finchel suggested that a payment of Three thousand ($3,000.) Dollars be made him in account of services rendered and that a payment of Five hundred ($500.) Dollars he made on account of disbursements. A somewhat lengthy discussion followed as to what compensation or fee Mr. Finchel had agreed to do the work for and on motion duly made, seconded and carried, it was voted that the communication be referred to the Cemetery Committee for consideration and that it report back to the Board at the next regular meetings its findings and recommendations.
