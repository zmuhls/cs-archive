For the current school year, New York City reports 101 elementary schools with 1,203 classes on curtailed sessions. With few exceptions, the city now has buildings, additions, or modernization projects under construction or in the 1952 capital program which will provide relief for these schools.

Relief for some of the exceptions depends on site acquisition, but in most instances it depends on such factors as completion of modernization projects, rehabilitation of existing schools, readjustment of attendance areas, provision of transportation and other means for increasing the utilization of available school space in the area.

The volume of school construction both in the city and the rest of the State in 1951 reached the highest level in more than 20 years.

Modernization or Replacement

The Commission has devoted a substantial part of its resources to the problem of bringing existing school facilities up to acceptable standards. Its findings and recommendations on this problem are summarized in a later section.

In its inventory of school facilities in the State and special studies in New York City, the Commission found that cities generally have a large problem involving rehabilitation, modernization or replacement of existing school buildings. It also found many substandard school facilities in all types of school districts.

Little progress was made during the year in bringing existing school plants up to what the Commission believes is reasonable standards. The shortage of essential materials and high building costs undoubtedly are contributing to the delay. Rising enrollments also are a factor. To accommodate increased enrollments, many cities are planning new buildings which will later become replacements for existing buildings after the enrollment peak has receded.

Forecast of Needs

The Commission made a major effort during the past two years to find methods, procedures and standards which can and should be used locally to make more accurate estimates of the need for new school buildings.

The determination of future need for school facilities in individual school districts or segments of school districts presents difficult questions, most of which can best be answered at the local level once the facts are known. As pointed out previously by the Commission, future need is affected by a great many factors, such as: Changes in district boundaries; capacity, utilization and condition of existing buildings; space standards; relative advantages and costs of rehabilitating, modernizing or replacing existing buildings; policy and standards on design and construction of new buildings; estimates of future enrollments, and policy on accommodations for temporary enrollment increases.

The Commission has completed its studies of enrollment forecasting and these are summarized in its first manual which now is being printed for the guidance of local officials. The fact that the number of births in 1951 almost reached the 1947 peak means that enrollment problems will create school building problems for another fifteen or sixteen years. However, the Commission has found no reason for altering its conclusion that the present high level of births is not likely to continue very long.

In a second manual being prepared the Commission will detail its findings to date on costs, costs and economies in the design and construction of school buildings.

Still in the experimental stage are standards and procedures for determining the capacity, utilization, condition and relative advantages and costs of rehabilitating, modernizing, or replacing existing substandard building.

The Commission is still working to solve remaining difficulties hampering reliable forecasts of school building requirements. (See Third Section).

Lighting Study

In considering the development of designs for better schools at lower cost, the Commission gave special attention to the effect of classroom lighting standards. Research has indicated that by effective use of modern artificial lighting techniques, window space may be reduced and more functional classrooms designed at lower construction cost.

The question unanswered, however, was: Would the reduction in window areas and the greater use of artificial lighting harm the physical and mental health of children?

A committee of physicists, lighting engineers, architects, educators and parents was asked by the Commission to study this question.
