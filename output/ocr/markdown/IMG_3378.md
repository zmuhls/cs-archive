Mansart E. Saganet

An Old English Reader.

The following century of fifty years
has seen the old family, where little
children need of read, the old family,
where little children need of read,
But from the leaves of long-withold
Exhales from long-withold
Exhales from long-withold
And as I turn them, and as I turn them,
And as I turn them, and as I turn them,
A fading pencil mark discloses.
A fading pencil mark discloses.
The building loves of last and bad,
The building loves of last and bad,
The building loves of last and bad,
Gray swifts and stout, and stately,
Gray swifts and stout, and stately,
Gray swifts and stout, and stately,
They follow still in learning their path,
They follow still in learning their path,
They follow still in learning their path,
Intent to march still in learning their path,
Intent to march still in learning their path,
Intent to march still in learning their path,
And happy ears are bending their path,
And happy ears are bending their path,
And happy ears are bending their path,
Above some modern "English Reader."
Above some modern "English Reader."
Above some modern "English Reader."

For I'll put this book for this book
In dally fold of fragrant satin;
In dally fold of fragrant satin;
In dally fold of fragrant satin;
More worthy to me than immortal Greek;
More worthy to me than immortal Greek;
More worthy to me than immortal Greek;
Or proud sonorous Latin;
Or proud sonorous Latin;
Or proud sonorous Latin;
Though Ruth and Benjamin have taught them,
Though Ruth and Benjamin have taught them,
Though Ruth and Benjamin have taught them,
Forgotten much their teachers have taught them,
Forgotten much their teachers have taught them,
Forgotten much their teachers have taught them,
The joy their life-long love has brought them.
The joy their life-long love has brought them.
The joy their life-long love has brought them.
The joy their life-long love has brought them.
The joy their life-long love has brought them.
The joy their life-long love has brought them.
