[Note: The document appears to be a copy of meeting minutes from the Antiville High School district, likely from the late 19th or early 20th century. The archaic spelling ("thorenupon" for "thereupon") and formatting are preserved as requested. The signature at the bottom is illegible, so it's marked as [illegible].]
