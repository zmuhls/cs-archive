Special Meeting of the Board of Education held on  
Thursday, June 13, 1935, at 8 o'clock p. m.,  
pursuant to the call of the President and for the purpose of making up a tentative budget for the 1935-36 school year.

The meeting was called to order by Clinton Inglee,  
President.

Present:  
Mr. Clinton Inglee, President.  
Mrs. Florence Hartman,  
Mrs. Theodore F. Axtell, Jr.,  
Mr. Christian Hanb,  
Mr. Herbert H. Case,  
Mr. Milford H. Ketcham, Trustees.  
Mr. C. R. Warron, Clerk.

Absent:  
Mr. Willet F. Whitmore, Trustee.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that the specifications for the extension of the central heating plant provided for the installation of a Simplex boiler and that the Architect had been informed that such boiler could only be delivered in one unit which would require the tearing down of a part of the boiler room, resulting in additional cost for the project. The Committee reported that the Architect recommended the amending of the specifications to allow the use of the Pacific boiler which could be delivered in two sections. Mr. Haub moved and Mrs. Hartman seconded the motion that the Pacific boiler be used in place of the Simplex boiler as specified in the specifications for the construction of the central heating plant. This motion unanimously carried.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported on the advisability of heating the schools with oil instead of coal and recommended that plans and specifications be prepared and bids received for the installation of oil burners. Mr. Haub moved and Mr. Axtell seconded the motion that Lewis Inglee be authorized to have plans and specifications prepared for the installation of oil burners and that this project be considered as an integral part of the central heating program authorized by the voters and that the Clerk be authorized and directed to advertise for bids as provided for by the Education Law. This motion unanimously carried.

Mr. Moran and Mr. Hudson, Trustees of the Village of Amityville, appeared before the Board and asked that the District take over the annual appropriation of $3,000.00 for the support of the Amityville Free Public Library.
