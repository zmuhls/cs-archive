Regular Meeting of the Board of Education held at the
High School on Thursday, July 3, 1930, at 8:00 o'clock P. M.,
pursuant to notice.

Present:
Mr. Clinton Inglee, President.
Mr. Louis Vogel,
Herbert M. Case,
Willet P. Whitmore,
Mrs. Florence Hertman,
Grace Burns, Trustees.
Mr. C. R. Warren, Clerk.

Absent:
Mr. Lawrence E. Colt, Trustee.
Mr. R. A. Gardiner, Treasurer.

The minutes of the previous regular meeting read and on
motion made, duly seconded and carried, it was voted that the
resolution adopted theret fixing the salary of Lucille M.
Robinson, School Nurse, at $2,100. per school year be charged
to read $2,200. per school year and that such minutes be
approved as read with the aforesaid correction.

Mr. Vogel reported that plans for the showers to the
rear of the High School auditorium had been submitted to
Albany and the State Department of Education had recommended
certain changes and that such revised plans would bring the
cost of the project up to about $29,000. Mr. Vogel stated
that Architect Inglee was drawing up plans for showers over
the coal bin and asked that the Board not award contract for
the supplying of buckwheat coal at this meeting as the placing
of showers over the coal bin would probably call for the
installation of oil burners.

Pursuant to advertisements duly published in the local
newspapers the following bids were received for supplying
125 gross tons of egg coal to the Grammar School Building
and 150 gross tons of buckwheat coal to the High School
Building:

Egg Coal Bid     Buckwheat Coal Bid
Wilbur F. Heinley $15.50          $ 7.40
Norman D. Heff    13.49           7.64
Nassau Coal Company, Inc. 15.40     8.95

On motion made, duly seconded and carried, it was voted
that the order for 125 gross tons of egg coal be awarded to
Wilbur F. Heinley and Norman D. Heff on a fifty-fifty basis.
