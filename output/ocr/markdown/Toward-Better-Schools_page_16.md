City's 1951 capital program were received within that year. All except one of the schools were authorized for construction by the Board of Estimate and contracts were awarded. The one exception is a school which, after receipt of bids, was deferred to 1952 for redesign to effect economies.

The 1951 capital program cost almost $67 million of which $19 million was for eight projects carried over from the previous year.

Successful initiation of this large program is evidence of increased co-operation among the City agencies concerned with the construction of schools. As an example of this new co-operation, it can be noted that advance agreement among City agencies enabled the Board of Education's Bureau of Design to start preparation of plans for eight of the schools in the 1952 program two months before the beginning of the year.

The 1951 program, however, was criticized in the interim report of the Education Management Survey, a subcommittee of the New York City Mayor's Committee on Management Survey.

The Survey recommended elimination of six of the projects included in the Board of Education's 1951 program and transfer of this money to other projects for which greater need could be established. The Survey declared the six schools unnecessary, if existing schools in their areas were better utilized.

Commenting on the Survey's recommendation, without passing upon the substantiation of need for any school, the Mayor's Committee said that "Adequate organization and procedures do not now exist to assure that sound decisions of this sort will be arrived at."

The Committee strongly recommended that "decisions as to new construction be deferred wherever possible, pending development of a greatly strengthened planning organization."

The Board of Education, however, made no changes in its 1951 program.

The Commission endorses this recommendation of the Mayor's Committee with respect to new construction. Although a start has been made by the Board of Education toward accomplishing the recommended changes in organization and procedures, they need to be carried through promptly, if sound decisions are to be made and the school building problem met.

The Commission believes inclusion of a school project in a capital program does not and should not necessarily preclude further consideration of its desirability by the Board of Education. The decision to build a particular school should be carefully reviewed to determine whether its priority should be changed. This procedure is particularly advisable in New York City in view of the sluggish development of a planning organization in the Board of Education.

In 1952, opportunities to transfer allocations to other more urgently needed school projects undoubtedly will present themselves.
