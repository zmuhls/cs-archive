**Determining Needs and Priorities**

During the past year, the Board of Education has made improvements in its methods for determining school building needs. Enrollment forecasts have been much more realistic because greater attention is being given to migration, non-public school enrollments, and large-scale housing developments.

Further refinement of its estimates is being attempted in 1952 by the Board's staff. New techniques are being developed in cooperation with other City agencies and the staff of this Commission.

Realistic revisions in enrollment forecasts during the year have cut down estimates of the amount of construction required to reduce overcrowding. As a result, plant replacement or modernization projects have been moved up in priority.

As pointed out by the Education Management Survey, procedures have not yet been established to substantiate adequately the need for construction, or the order of need, especially where the questions of existing capacity, utilization, and modernization or replacement are involved.

One of the major purposes of the Commission's area study, discussed later in this report, is to develop and refine such procedures.

**Removing Site Problems**

Site problems have been reduced to a minimum by adoption of the Commission's proposal that, in so far as determination of priorities permits, money for acquisition of sites be allocated sufficiently in advance to make possible clearance and preparation well ahead of construction.

No project in 1951 was deferred because of inability to clear a site. A dozen sites for buildings on the 1952 program already are available and the others are expected to be available as needed during the year.

The problem of encumbered sites has been minimized by scheduling projects so that they are included in
