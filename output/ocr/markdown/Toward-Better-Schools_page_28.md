These standards require natural light as the primary source for classrooms and among the requirements is the following:

"The distance from the floor to the top of the window should be equal to or greater than half the width of the room, less one foot."

Although the purpose of this requirement is to increase natural light in the classroom, experience has shown that drawn shades and other methods of reducing glare and unpleasant sunlight actually defeat this purpose.

Its practical effect is to require that classrooms be constructed approximately 22 or 23 feet wide, with unnecessarily high ceilings. This produces relatively long, narrow classrooms, although other shapes would be more functional for many types of classroom activity. In instances where wide classrooms have been built, costly construction to obtain supplemental natural light has been necessary.

This provision also increases the amount of corridor space, exterior wall and eaveage required for the building and consequently increases costs.

The Commission was convinced that a lighting standard based upon a satisfactory combination of artificial and natural lighting would make possible more functional and economical school buildings. However, because any change in the standard might have an effect on the health of the children, the Commission sought expert advice from specialists in this field and representatives of organizations and agencies concerned with the problem.

Lieutenant Governor Frank C. Moore, Chairman of the Commission, on October 8, 1951 designated a 19-member committee to review the State's present lighting standards and offer recommendations for changes, if they could be made without harmful effect on the children.

As a result of its thorough studies, this committee will submit a report to the Commission and the State Education Department recommending new standards for the use of artificial lighting. Adoption of the committee's recommendations would permit the design of simpler school buildings having squarer rooms, lower ceilings, less corridor space and reduced exterior wall area. The result would be lower construction costs and more useful classrooms.

The Commission takes this opportunity to publicly thank the committee members for their unselfish service and valuable work.

Standards for Existing Buildings

The Commission pointed out last year the difficulty of obtaining dependable information on the capacity of the public school buildings which are in satisfactory condition. Without this information, a reliable estimate of future school needs in the State cannot be made.

The Commission has completed its inventory of school facilities outside the City of New York and has computed capacity and utilization data for almost all of these school buildings.

Overcrowded, extremely substandard and underutilized schools and unsatisfactory temporary facilities will be given further study.

During the year, the City of New York has improved its inventory of elementary school buildings, but it still lacks adequate information on its high schools.

It is clear at this stage that cities generally have a major task in bringing many of their school buildings up to acceptable standards.

However, after studying this problem two years, the Commission is now convinced that reliable and useful information of this kind cannot be obtained for the State as a whole. It requires a special study in each school district. It was one of the major reasons why the State Education Department did not apply for Federal funds to make the Federal school facilities survey.
