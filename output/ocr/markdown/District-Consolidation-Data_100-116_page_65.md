**Notes:**

* The "DATE OF SCHOOL MEETING ORGANIZING DISTRICT" and "DATE ON WHICH PAPERS WERE APPROVED AT DEPARTMENT" columns are split into "Day," "Month," and "Year" for clarity.
* The "No. of Teachers" column contains numerical values filled in by hand.
* The "REMARKS" column is blank for all entries.
* The handwritten entries for "NAME OF TOWN" are clearly legible.
* The form is pre-printed with labels, and the handwritten entries are filled in accordingly.
