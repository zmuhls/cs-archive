"In view of the fact that I shall be absent from the Board for about two months I hereby tender my resignation as vice-president of the Board."

The members of the Board were all of the opinion that no action should be taken on the resignation and the President thereupon directed that the communication be tabled.

The President reported that Alex Smith had met with an accident on December 28th resulting in a slight fracture of the skull and that the Board had filed a suit of the injury with the insurance carrier through Latham & Colyer. Mr. Whiting moved and Mr. Axtell seconded the motion that the Clerk convey to Mr. Smith an expression of sympathy from the Board and the hope for a speedy recovery. This motion unanimously carried.

Mr. Ruff reported that in conjunction with the Transportation Committee an investigation had been made of the need for additional bus service on Albany Avenue south of Smith Street; that apparently the children in that section were being discriminated against and that twenty to thirty-five additional children required transportation which would necessitate the employment of an extra bus. After some deliberation, Mr. Case moved and Mr. Hanb seconded the motion that the Transportation Committee be authorized to have another bus out on the Albany Avenue route for the balance of the school year if after further investigation the Committee finds it necessary to take this step to remedy the apparent discrimination now existing. This motion unanimously carried.

The President reported that the New York Board of Fire Underwriters had sent in a notice of defective electrical equipment in the old Grammar School building and that John Styles had been authorized to correct the defects and arrange for re-inspection and acceptance.

The Teachers Committee reported no unexcusable absences for the month of December 1934 but that Katharine Hildreth had substituted for seven days; Emma Karath, five days; Elmina Darling, two days; and Aneline Kinno, two days. Mr. Case seconded the motion that the report be accepted and placed on file and that the substitute teachers be paid accordingly. This motion unanimously carried.

Mrs. Hartman submitted the cafeteria report for the period ending December 31, 1934. It was ordered accepted and placed on file.
