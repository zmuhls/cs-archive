sion and Bureau of the Budget and the pilot study was launched in August, 1951, in an area bounded by the Hudson River on the west and Central Park on the east. North and south boundaries fixed tentatively at 116th Street and 59th Street were left to adjustment as the study progressed.

The purpose of this study is to test standards and procedures already developed by the Commission and the New York City agencies and to seek agreement on the data, standards, procedures, organization and staffing required to determine and justify the need for school buildings in a given area—with particular attention to modernization versus replacement.

A second purpose is to discover, if possible, a method of establishing the relative order of construction for all types of needs.

Although the study is being conducted in the City of New York, the information developed from it is expected to be equally valuable in making rehabilitation, modernization or replacement determinations in other cities of the State.

Staff representatives from the Commission and the City agencies have organized committees on capacity and utilization of buildings, inventory and appraisal of buildings and enrollment estimation.

To date these results have been achieved:

1. The Committee on Capacity and Utilization has agreed upon a definition of terms and has determined the standards and methods to be applied in computing capacity.

2. The Committee on Enrollment Estimation has prepared maps showing public and parochial school enrollment and utilization; has tentatively forecast future enrollments and has compiled figures on migration and birth rate.

3. The Committee on Inventory and Appraisal, after studying and testing two methods, has adopted a concise rating form for recording information on a school building.
