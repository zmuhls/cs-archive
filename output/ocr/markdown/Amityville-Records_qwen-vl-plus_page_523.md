## Transcription

A special meeting of the Board of Education was held at the
High School on Thursday, June 21, 1928, at 8:00 P. M., pursuant
to the call of the President:

Present:
Mr. Clinton Inglese, President.
Mr. Ed. F. J. Thorn,
" John B. Carwell,
" Louis Vogel,
" Vedder Van Dyck,
Mrs. Grace Burns, Trustees.
Mr. G. R. Warren, Secretary.

Absent:
Mrs. Florence Hartman, Trustee.
Mr. R. A. Gardiner, Treasurer.

The President stated that the meeting was called to consider
the cemetery matter.

Mr. Harry Paul Fischel, Counselor at Law, appeared before
the Board, together with Mrs. Knapp.

Mr. Fischel outlined in full just what had been accomplished
to date and reported that work had been started on the "petition"
and that it should be completed sometime this summer in time
to present to the fall term of the Supreme Court.

Mr. Fischel suggested that if the Board desired to release
him as Attorney in the cemetery matter, that he would be very
glad to step aside and would willingly turn over to his successor
all the basic work which he had so far accomplished. No action
was taken on this suggestion.

The members of the Board agreed, that from the visit of
Mr. Fischel, a much more comprehensive outlook on the prop-
osition had been obtained.

There being no further business, the meeting thereupon
adjoined.

C. R. Warren
Secretary
