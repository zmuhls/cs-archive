[Note: The document appears to be a transcription of a meeting minute from the New York State Common School system, likely from the early 20th century based on the date mentioned (1939). The original document seems to have been microfilmed, as indicated by the "MICROFILMED BY GOOD SHEPHERD WORK SERVICES" stamp on the left side. The text is presented in a formal, typewritten style typical of official records from that era.]
