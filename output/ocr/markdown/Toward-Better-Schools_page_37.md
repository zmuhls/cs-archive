The 10 per cent increase fixed as the eligibility minimum is more than double the normal attendance increase which school districts can expect in the next five or six years.

The Commission estimates the cost of this program in the school year beginning July 1, 1952, will be approximately $1,800,000. Because the State fiscal year and the school year of these districts does not coincide, however, it is estimated that the cost in the State fiscal year beginning April 1, 1952, will be about $900,000.

Governor Dewey's proposed budget for the 1952-53 State fiscal year already contains a $900,000 appropriation to finance the emergency statute now in effect for rapidly growing districts. Consequently, no change in this appropriation would be necessary. However, an appropriation of $1,800,000 probably will be required in the State fiscal year beginning April 1, 1953.

If the Commission's proposal for assistance to the rapidly growing districts were in effect at the present time, it is possible that as many as 67 school districts in 17 counties would be eligible for participation.

5. Education Law Amendments

In an effort to help the localities avoid costly mistakes, the Commission last year sponsored legislation giving the State Education Commissioner power to approve sites as well as plans and specifications of school buildings in districts having less than 70,000 population. This year, the Commission is recommending two amendments to this law which will:

A. Require the district to follow specified criteria before title to the site is acquired.

B. Provide that the Commissioner of Education may approve plans for school buildings on sites that

are deficient in one or more respects if a site conforming to all standards is not available.

Other changes which the Commission proposes are these:

A. Amend Section 409 of the Education Law to make it clear that the Education Commissioner's regulations under this section do not apply to city school districts in cities having 70,000 or more population.

B. Delete the last sentence in Section 1806, subdivision 1 e of the Education Law to eliminate difficulties experienced in interpretation. At the time of voting on a bond issue it is impossible to get more than an estimate of cost, so that the voters cannot be advised of any excess of actual cost over computed building cost.

C. Increase from $50 to $100 the amount which the trustees of common school districts may spend for repairs, furniture and equipment without a vote of the district under subdivision 14 of Section 1604 of the Education Law; and from $150 to $300 the amount which a trustee of such district may expend for repairs without a vote of the people when ordered by the district superintendent to do so under subdivision 4 of Section 2215 of the Education Law.

6. Continue the Commission

In his 1952 message to the Legislature, Governor Dewey commended the Commission for its work and recommended its continuation for another year. Legislation to continue the Commission already has been approved. A bill appropriating $100,000 for its work in the 1952-53 State fiscal year will be introduced.

A large volume of important work remains to be done. For instance:

A. It is anticipated a shortage of materials will continue to be a major problem in school construction during the year. The Commission will continue its efforts to find methods of conserving materials needed in the nation's defense effort and will assist small districts to obtain Federal approval of essential school construction and Federal allocation of critical materials. Small districts frequently are at a disadvantage in obtaining construction priorities because they lack the direct contact with Federal officials that is possessed by many cities.

B. In the fall of 1952, many more school districts will begin to feel the effects of increased enrollments in the elementary schools. It is expected there will be an increase in the number of districts seeking advances of State money for emergency school building construction. The Commission will endeavor to simplify and improve the administration of the emergency advance statute.

C. It is expected that the review and revision of State equalization rates will be completed within the year. Establishment of new rates will require a review of local financial resources, reconsideration of the formula used in making advances of money for local debt service on emergency school construction and an examination of the effect changes in the State education formula will have upon the ability of localities to finance their own school building requirements.
