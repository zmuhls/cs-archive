Announcement for 1927-28

Sixth, it has been the practice of the Retirement Board, under a bylaw provision, to require an interval of thirty days between the time of application for retirement and the actual beginning of the retirement allowance. This practice has resulted in litigation in two or three instances, and the board always had been sustained. The amendment to the law, therefore, recognizes beyond question this thirty-day period. This amendment is to the advantage of members of the system in general. It has been pointed out that the reason for this thirty-day limit is a financial one as well as the evident intent of the original statute. If members who become ill suddenly, apply for retirement, taking an option insuring their lives in favor of a beneficiary, and die within a few days, the fund would suffer greatly by the payment of large sums of money to persons who were never teachers. When the retirement law was drawn, calculations were made on the basis of allowing thirty days before claims became effective. A careful estimate by Dr. Buck, the actuary who was responsible for the drafting of the retirement law, gives the probable increased annual cost to the system as $590,000, if such thirty-day rule were not applied. To meet such an increased cost, considerably larger contributions would have to be made both by teachers and communities.

A law was also passed at the last session of the Legislature which increases the salary of each district superintendent to $3,000, and which requires such superintendents to be college graduates, with at least three years' experience in teaching or supervision.
