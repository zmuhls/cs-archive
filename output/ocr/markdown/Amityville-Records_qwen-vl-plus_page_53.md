remove the same with the exception of J. G. Francis of Ketchum Avenue who thought that the Board should defer the expense of moving his garage. Mr. Francis in a communication dated May 18th informed the Board that he had not placed his garage on the property acquired by the District with any intention of desire to appropriate something which did not belong to him but due to erroneous information given him by a former member of the Board. The matter was ordered laid over for later consideration.

Mr. S. T. Hildroth appeared before the Board and read the following clause in proposed architect's contract:

"The Architect agrees to have a competent representative on the job daily during the working hours for a period not exceeding eight months, from time work starts on the erection of the before building; said daily representative to start on work at time first concrete is to be poured and remain on the job daily during hours while actual construction work is being done. He will put forth his best efforts to see that the terms of the contract are rigidly enforced."

After due consideration of the matter it was suggested that the contract be amended to stipulate that the representative must be approved by the Board.

After the contract had been corrected in accordance with the Board's request Mr. Hildroth moved that it be daily approved. Moved, seconded, and carried, that the contract as prepared by Mr. Hildroth be executed by the proper officers of the Board.

Committee on engaging Consulting Architect reported and recommended that Harry Keith White of New York City be designated as Consulting Architect on the following basis:

"Five Hundred ($500.) Dollar retainer fee to cover examination of final plans and specifications. Other services at $10.00 per hour for brief periods and $75.00 per day for daily services plus traveling expenses."

Moved, duly seconded and carried, that Harry Keith White of New York City be engaged as Consulting Architect on the basis outlined in the Committee report.

The Building and Grounds Committee reported that two additional outside classrooms could be rented in the Masonic Temple at a rental of $100.00 per month over and above the $200.00 paid for the two rooms now under lease. The Committee recommended that the Board take action to secure the two additional rooms.
