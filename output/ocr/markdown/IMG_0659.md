Announcement for 1927-28

probably be made in many parts of the State during the next year. Of course your Association will do everything possible and honorable to prevent such reduction. In fact, the Association will work for further increases rather than decreases because salaries for good teachers have never been sufficient and never will be too high. We shall need the support and co-operation of all the teachers in these revenue and salary campaigns ahead of us and in our other campaigns for the welfare of teachers and children and the good of the schools in general. NO teacher can afford NOT to be a MEMBER of the State Association.

The Association will use its influence to promote the passage of a law which will pro- tect the present State quotas for teachers and, if possible, to secure increased and equitable distribution of State asistance in the financial support of schools. The Association proposes to find out what the local and rural authorities wish and to assist in securing such legisla- tion as the rural school authorities feel is needed. It will work for the passage of a law giving administrative independence to school boards so that boards may determine the amount and collect the resources necessary for a successful administra- tion of school systems and may enable them to pay teachers a just compensation without restriction by municipal authorities.

To secure the passage of a law which will place all health education, including medical inspection and school nursing, entirely under the jurisdiction of educational authorities rather than under the control of boards of health.
