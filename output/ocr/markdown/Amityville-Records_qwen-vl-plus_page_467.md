BOARD OF EDUCATION
ASHVILLE, N.Y.

Tuition Received
in
Amityville Public Schools

Kindergarten, 1st & 2nd grades - - - $15 plus cost of books
3rd, 4th and 5th grades - - - 20 = = = =
6th, 7th & 8th grades - - - 25 = = = =
High School - - - 100

1. To the amounts indicated above for the first eight grades about $40 per year should be added as State Money.

2. The amounts paid for books have usually ranged from $4 or $5 per pupil in the High School.

3. For the year 1926-27 the District received for high school pupils about $120 per pupil from the State and $50 from the pupils' home district.

4. In case of perfect attendance our District will receive
$72.72 for attendance
$50.00 per pupil from State
$0.00 per pupil from District

5. Individual pupils whose tuition is not paid by their home district might be charged $100 per year since in addition to that amount the State will pay $72.72 in case of perfect attendance.

6. It will be remembered that in my annual report I computed cost per pupil in the elementary school to be $135 per pupil and in the high school $186 per pupil. The cost of instruction per capita probably varies $20 from the first to the eighth grade.

7. The selling of books to non-resident pupils entails considerable trouble when all the clerical details are considered. An adequate tuition charge could justify the loan of books to the non-resident on the same plan as to our own pupils.
