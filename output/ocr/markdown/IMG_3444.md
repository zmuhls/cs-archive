School Costs Up 119% in 12 Years, Salaries Covering 80% of Budgets

Inflated costs have compelled many communities in this area to double their school expenditures in the last twelve years, it was announced yesterday in a report made public by the Metropolitan School Study Council.

The report dealt with the cost of public education in the sixty school systems that are members of public education in the sixty school systems that are members of the council, an affiliate of Columbia University's Teachers College. The member schools, situated in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, were termed "the best supported large group of public schools in the United States" by Dr. Paul R. Mort, Professor of Educational Administration at the college.

In attempting to maintain the quality of their education programs despite inflation and a growing number of students, the communities have increased expenditures by 119 per cent since the 1939-40 school year, the report said. The highest item in the schools' budgets was salaries, with more than 80 per cent of the expenditures going for teaching, administrative and custodial services. The report cited evidence that the cost of such services had risen 260 per cent of the 1939-40 figures.

Salaries for the council schools in the current academic year range from $2,400 to $7,200 a year for 40,363 teachers, with eighty-three teachers receiving more than $7,000 a year. Last year, only eighteen teachers were in the latter bracket. Only six teachers now receive less than $2,600, the report said.

The report observed that state-wise, New York is highest, with an average salary of $5,170, Connecticut's average is $4,550, while New Jersey's is $4,250. [stamp: Metropolitan School Study Council]
