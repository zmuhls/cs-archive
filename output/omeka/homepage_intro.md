# Welcome to the NYS Free School Archive
The NY Free School Archive documents New York State's historical transformation from  one-room schoolhouses to a centralized public education system. Through legislative records, teachers' association proceedings, and district consolidation data, its collections feature how local schools became links in a broader network between 1845-1940.

This archive preserves the voices of teachers organizing for professional standards, the administrative records of consolidation campaigns, and the daily evidence of a federated school system taking shape—revealing the moment when the school became not just a local institution, but part of a state.
